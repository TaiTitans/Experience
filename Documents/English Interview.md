### Behavioral Questions là gì?

Behavioral questions thường bắt đầu bằng các cụm từ như "Tell me about a time when..." (Kể về một lần mà...) hoặc "Give me an example of..." (Cho tôi một ví dụ về...). Họ muốn bạn kể lại trải nghiệm thực tế để xem cách bạn xử lý tình huống trong công việc.

### Một số câu hỏi phổ biến

Dưới đây là danh sách các câu hỏi behavioral thường gặp khi phỏng vấn Software Engineer, kèm theo gợi ý cách trả lời ngắn gọn:

1. **"Tell me about a time when you had to solve a difficult technical problem."**  
    _(Kể về một lần bạn phải giải quyết một vấn đề kỹ thuật khó khăn.)_
    - Gợi ý: Hãy kể về một bug phức tạp hoặc một tính năng khó mà bạn đã xử lý. Dùng mô hình STAR (Situation - Task - Action - Result): mô tả tình huống, nhiệm vụ bạn được giao, hành động bạn thực hiện, và kết quả đạt được.
2. **"Give me an example of a time you worked in a team to complete a project."**  
    _(Cho tôi một ví dụ về lần bạn làm việc nhóm để hoàn thành một dự án.)_
    - Gợi ý: Nói về cách bạn phối hợp với đồng đội, vai trò của bạn trong nhóm, và dự án thành công thế nào.
3. **"Describe a situation where you had to meet a tight deadline."**  
    _(Mô tả một tình huống bạn phải hoàn thành công việc với thời hạn gấp rút.)_
    - Gợi ý: Kể về cách bạn quản lý thời gian, ưu tiên công việc, và kết quả cuối cùng (ví dụ: giao sản phẩm đúng hạn).
4. **"Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a teammate or manager. How did you handle it?"**  
    _(Kể về một lần bạn bất đồng ý kiến với đồng đội hoặc quản lý. Bạn đã xử lý thế nào?)_
    - Gợi ý: Tập trung vào cách bạn giao tiếp, giữ thái độ chuyên nghiệp, và tìm giải pháp chung.
5. **"Have you ever made a mistake in your code? How did you fix it?"**  
    _(Bạn đã từng mắc lỗi trong mã code chưa? Bạn sửa nó thế nào?)_
    - Gợi ý: Thành thật kể về một lỗi cụ thể, cách bạn phát hiện, và bước bạn thực hiện để khắc phục.
6. **"Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new technology or tool quickly."**  
    _(Kể về một lần bạn phải học một công nghệ hoặc công cụ mới trong thời gian ngắn.)_
    - Gợi ý: Nêu rõ công nghệ đó là gì, bạn học nó ra sao (tự học, tài liệu, khóa học), và áp dụng nó như thế nào.
7. **"Describe a time when you went above and beyond for a project."**  
    _(Mô tả một lần bạn nỗ lực vượt mong đợi cho một dự án.)_
    - Gợi ý: Kể về lần bạn làm thêm giờ, tối ưu code, hoặc đề xuất ý tưởng mới để cải thiện sản phẩm.

### Mẹo trả lời

- **Dùng STAR Method**: Như mình đã nhắc ở trên, hãy cấu trúc câu trả lời theo 4 phần: Situation (Tình huống), Task (Nhiệm vụ), Action (Hành động), Result (Kết quả). Điều này giúp câu trả lời của bạn rõ ràng và logic.
- **Thành thật nhưng tích cực**: Đừng ngại kể về sai lầm, nhưng hãy nhấn mạnh cách bạn học hỏi và cải thiện.
- **Liên kết với công việc**: Nếu có thể, hãy chọn các ví dụ liên quan đến kỹ năng lập trình hoặc công nghệ mà công ty đang tìm kiếm.

### Ví dụ minh họa

**Câu hỏi**: "Tell me about a time when you had to solve a difficult technical problem."  
**Trả lời mẫu**:  
_"In my previous role (Situation), I was tasked with fixing a performance issue in a web application that was slowing down due to inefficient database queries (Task). I analyzed the codebase, identified the bottleneck in the SQL queries, and rewrote them to use indexing and batch processing (Action). As a result, the page load time decreased by 60%, and the client was really happy with the improvement (Result)."_


**Câu hỏi**: "Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a teammate or manager. How did you handle it?"  
**Trả lời mẫu**:  
_"While working on a project at my last job (Situation), my team lead suggested using a third-party library to speed up development for a feature, but I noticed it had some security vulnerabilities that could affect our application (Task). I researched the library’s documentation and found a few reported issues, so I approached my team lead privately and explained my concerns with specific examples. I also proposed an alternative solution: building a lightweight custom module instead, and offered to prototype it quickly to prove it could work (Action). After discussing it, he agreed to let me try my approach. The custom module ended up being more secure and saved us from potential issues down the line, and we still delivered on time (Result)."_

### Phân tích

- **Situation**: Mô tả bối cảnh – bất đồng xảy ra trong dự án.
- **Task**: Nêu rõ vấn đề – mình không đồng ý vì lý do bảo mật.
- **Action**: Hành động cụ thể – nghiên cứu, giao tiếp, đề xuất giải pháp.
- **Result**: Kết quả tích cực – vấn đề được giải quyết, dự án thành công.

### 1. "Tell me about a time when you had to solve a difficult technical problem."

**Trả lời**:  
_"In my previous role as a backend developer (Situation), I was assigned to fix a critical issue where our API was crashing under high traffic due to a memory leak (Task). I started by reproducing the issue in a test environment, then used profiling tools like Valgrind to trace the leak to an unoptimized data structure in our caching system. I refactored the code to use a more efficient algorithm and added proper memory management (Action). After deploying the fix, the API handled 10x more requests without crashing, and the team received positive feedback from the client (Result)."_

### 2. "Give me an example of a time you worked in a team to complete a project."

**Trả lời**:  
_"During my time at a startup (Situation), I collaborated with a team of four developers to build a customer dashboard for a SaaS product within a two-month deadline (Task). I took on the frontend development using React, while coordinating with the backend team to define API endpoints. We held daily standups to stay aligned and used Git for version control. I also helped debug a teammate’s code when they hit a roadblock (Action). We delivered the dashboard on time, and it increased user engagement by 25% according to analytics (Result)."_

### 3. "Describe a situation where you had to meet a tight deadline."

**Trả lời**:  
_"At my last job (Situation), I was tasked with deploying a payment integration feature for an e-commerce platform in just three days before a major sales event (Task). I prioritized the critical components first, like secure API calls, and worked late to test edge cases. I also communicated with the QA team to fast-track testing and used automation scripts to speed up deployment (Action). The feature went live on time, and it processed over 1,000 transactions flawlessly during the event (Result)."_

### 4. "Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a teammate or manager. How did you handle it?"

**Trả lời**:  
_"While working on a mobile app (Situation), my manager wanted to push a new feature to production without unit tests to meet a deadline, but I was concerned about potential bugs (Task). I scheduled a quick one-on-one, presented data from past releases showing how tests reduced errors, and suggested a compromise: write basic tests for the core functionality first. I volunteered to handle it myself to save time (Action). He agreed, and the feature launched with no major issues, proving the value of the tests (Result)."_

---

### 5. "Have you ever made a mistake in your code? How did you fix it?"

**Trả lời**:  
_"In an earlier project (Situation), I accidentally introduced a logic error in a sorting algorithm that caused incorrect data to display on a reporting dashboard (Task). I noticed it during a review when the numbers didn’t add up. I immediately traced the issue using debug logs, fixed the algorithm by adjusting the comparison logic, and added unit tests to prevent it from happening again (Action). The corrected version was deployed within hours, and I learned to double-check edge cases more carefully (Result)."_

### 6. "Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new technology or tool quickly."

**Trả lời**:  
_"At my current job (Situation), I was asked to integrate a GraphQL API into our system, but I’d never used it before, and we had a one-week deadline (Task). I spent the first day studying the official GraphQL docs and watching a crash course on YouTube. Then, I set up a small prototype to test queries and mutations, asking a senior dev for feedback to refine my approach (Action). By the end of the week, I successfully implemented the API, and it improved our data retrieval speed by 30% (Result)."_

---

### 7. "Describe a time when you went above and beyond for a project."

**Trả lời**:  
_"While working on a web app (Situation), I was responsible for basic CRUD operations, but I noticed the UI was slow due to redundant API calls (Task). Beyond my assigned scope, I spent extra hours researching and implementing a caching layer with Redis. I also documented the setup for the team and ran performance tests to confirm the improvement (Action). The page load time dropped by 50%, and the client praised the app’s responsiveness, which helped secure a follow-up contract (Result)."_


# What problem did you got when doing the university ?

I and my teammate didn't unify the standard of code before beginning to implement the project
