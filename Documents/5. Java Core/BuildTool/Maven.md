1. **Install Maven**: You can download Maven from the official website ([https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2. **Create a Maven Project**: You can create a new Maven project using your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) or by running the following command in your terminal:
```powershell
mvn archetype:generate
```

3. **Understand the Project Structure**: A typical Maven project has the following structure:
```xml
my-project/
├── pom.xml
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   └── java/
│   └── test/
│       └── java/
└── target/
```

4. **Manage Dependencies**: One of the most powerful features of Maven is its dependency management system. You can declare dependencies in your `pom.xml` file, and Maven will automatically download and manage those dependencies for you.
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        <version>2.7.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Build and Run Your Project**:

```powershell
mvn clean install
```

```powershell
java -jar target/my-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
