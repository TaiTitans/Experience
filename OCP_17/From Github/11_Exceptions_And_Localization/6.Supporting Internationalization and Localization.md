# Supporting Internationalization and Localization

Many applications need to work in different countries and with different languages. For
example, consider the sentence “The zoo is holding a special event on 4/1/22 to look at
animal behaviors.” When is the event? In the United States, it is on April 1. However, a
British reader would interpret this as January 4. A British reader might also wonder why we
didn’t write “behaviours.” If we are making a website or program that will be used in 
multiple countries, we want to use the correct language and formatting. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
_Internationalization_ is the process of designing your program so it can be adapted. This
involves placing strings in a properties file and ensuring that the proper data formatters are
used. _Localization_ means supporting multiple locales or geographic regions. You can think
of a locale as being like a language and country pairing. Localization includes translating
strings to different languages. It also includes outputting dates and numbers in the correct
format for that locale.

> #### Note
> Initially, your program does not need to support multiple locales. The key
is to future-proof your application by using these techniques. This way,
when your product becomes successful, you can add support for new
languages or regions without rewriting everything.

&emsp;&emsp;
In this section, we look at how to define a locale and use it to format dates, numbers,
and strings.

## I. Picking a Locale
While Oracle defines a locale as “a specific geographical, political, or cultural region,” you’ll
only see languages and countries on the exam. Oracle certainly isn’t going to delve into
political regions that are not countries. That’s too controversial for an exam! <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The **Locale** class is in the **java.util** package. The first useful **Locale** to find is the
user’s current locale. Try running the following code on your computer:

```java
Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
System.out.println(locale);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
When we run it, it prints `en_US`. It might be different for you. This default output tells us
that our computers are using English and are sitting in the United States. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Notice the format. First comes the lowercase language code. The language is always
required. Then comes an underscore followed by the uppercase country code. The country
is optional. Figure 11.6 shows the two formats for Locale objects that you are expected
to remember.

> **Figure 11.6** Locale Formats

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter11/unit6/figure11.6.png" alt="Figure 11.6" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
As practice, make sure that you understand why each of these Locale identifiers
is invalid:

```java
US      // Cannot have country without language
enUS    // Missing underscore
US_en   // The country and language are reversed
EN      // Language must be lowercase
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The corrected versions are **en** and **en_US**.

> #### Note
> You do not need to memorize language or country codes. The exam will
let you know about any that are being used. You do need to recognize
valid and invalid formats. Pay attention to uppercase/lowercase and the
underscore. For example, if you see a locale expressed as es_CO, then
you should know that the language is es and the country is CO, even if
you didn’t know that they represent Spanish and Colombia, respectively.

&emsp;&emsp;
As a developer, you often need to write code that selects a locale other than the default
one. There are three common ways of doing this. The first is to use the built-in constants in
the Locale class, available for some common locales.

```java
System.out.println(Locale.GERMAN);  // de
System.out.println(Locale.GERMANY); // de_DE
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first example selects the German language, which is spoken in many countries,
including Austria (de_AT) and Liechtenstein (de_LI). The second example selects both
German the language and Germany the country. While these examples may look similar, they
are not the same. Only one includes a country code. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The second way of selecting a **Locale** is to use the constructors to create a new object. You
can pass just a language, or both a language and country:

```java
System.out.println(new Locale("fr"));           // fr
System.out.println(new Locale("hi", "IN"));     // hi_IN
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first is the language French, and the second is Hindi in India. Again, you don’t need
to memorize the codes. There is another constructor that lets you be even more specific
about the locale. Luckily, providing a variant value is not on the exam. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Java will let you create a **Locale** with an invalid language or country, such as xx_XX.
However, it will not match the **Locale** that you want to use, and your program will not
behave as expected. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
There’s a third way to create a Locale that is more flexible. The builder design pattern
lets you set all of the properties that you care about and then build the Locale at the end.
This means that you can specify the properties in any order. The following two Locale
values both represent `en_US`:

```java
Locale l1 = new Locale.Builder()
    .setLanguage("en")
    .setRegion("US")
    .build();

Locale l2 = new Locale.Builder()
    .setRegion("US")
    .setLanguage("en")
    .build();
```

&emsp;&emsp;
When testing a program, you might need to use a **Locale** other than your computer’s default.

```java
System.out.println(Locale.getDefault());    // en_US
Locale locale = new Locale("fr");
Locale.setDefault(locale);
System.out.println(Locale.getDefault());    // fr
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Try it, and don’t worry—the **Locale** changes for only that one Java program. It does
not change any settings on your computer. It does not even change future executions of the
same program.

> #### Note
> The exam may use `setDefault()` because it can’t make assumptions
about where you are located. In practice, we rarely write code to change
a user’s default locale.

## II. Localizing Numbers
It might surprise you that formatting or parsing currency and number values can change
depending on your locale. For example, in the United States, the dollar sign is prepended
before the value along with a decimal point for values less than one dollar, such as $2.15. In
Germany, though, the euro symbol is appended to the value along with a comma for values
less than one euro, such as 2,15 €. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Luckily, the **java.text** package includes classes to save the day. The following sections
cover how to format numbers, currency, and dates based on the locale. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The first step to formatting or parsing data is the same: obtain an instance of a
**NumberFormat**. Table 11.8 shows the available factory methods. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Once you have the **NumberFormat** instance, you can call `format()` to turn a number into a
**String**, or you can use `parse()` to turn a **String** into a number.

> #### Tip
> The format classes are not thread-safe. Do not store them in **instance**
variables or **static** variables. You learn more about thread safety in
Chapter 13, “Concurrency.”

> **Table 11.8** Factory methods to get a **NumberFormat**
> 
> |Description| **Using default** Locale **and a specified** Locale                                                                              |
> |---|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> |General-purpose formatter | NumberFormat.getInstance()<br/>NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale locale)                                                           |
> |Same as getInstance | NumberFormat.getNumberInstance()<br/>NumberFormat.getNumberInstance(Locale locale)                                               |
> |For formatting monetary amounts | NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()<br/>NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(Locale locale)                                           |
> |For formatting percentages | NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()<br/>NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(Locale locale)                                             |
> |Rounds decimal values before displaying | NumberFormat.getIntegerInstance()<br/>NumberFormat.getIntegerInstance(Locale locale)                                             |
> |Returns compact number formatter | NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance()<br/>NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance(Locale locale, NumberFormat.Style formatStyle) |

### &emsp;&emsp; 1. Formatting Numbers
When we format data, we convert it from a structured object or primitive value into a
String. The `NumberFormat.format()` method formats the given number based on the
locale associated with the **NumberFormat** object. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s go back to our zoo for a minute. For marketing literature, we want to share the
average monthly number of visitors to the San Diego Zoo. The following shows printing out
the same number in three different locales:

```java
int attendeesPerYear = 3_200_000;
int attendeesPerMonth = attendeesPerYear / 12;

var us = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.US);
System.out.println(us.format(attendeesPerMonth)); // 266,666

var gr = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.GERMANY);
System.out.println(gr.format(attendeesPerMonth)); // 266.666

var ca = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.CANADA_FRENCH);
System.out.println(ca.format(attendeesPerMonth)); // 266 666
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This shows how our U.S., German, and French Canadian guests can all see the same
information in the number format they are accustomed to using. In practice, we would
just call `NumberFormat.getInstance()` and rely on the user’s default locale to format
the output. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Formatting currency works the same way.

```java
double price = 48;
var myLocale = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
System.out.println(myLocale.format(price));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
When run with the default locale of en_US for the United States, this code outputs
$48.00. On the other hand, when run with the default locale of en_GB for Great Britain, it
outputs £48.00.

> #### Note
> In the real world, use **int** or **BigDecimal** for money and not double.
Doing math on amounts with double is dangerous because the values
are stored as floating-point numbers. Your boss won’t appreciate it if you
lose pennies or fractions of pennies during transactions!

&emsp;&emsp;
Finally, the exam may have examples that show formatting percentages:

```java
double successRate = 0.802;
var us = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(Locale.US);
System.out.println(us.format(successRate)); // 80%

var gr = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(Locale.GERMANY);
System.out.println(gr.format(successRate)); // 80 %
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Not much difference, we know, but you should at least be aware that the ability to print a
percentage is locale-specific for the exam!

### &emsp;&emsp; 2. Parsing Numbers
When we parse data, we convert it from a String to a structured object or primitive
value. The `NumberFormat.parse()` method accomplishes this and takes the locale into
consideration. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
For example, if the locale is the English/United States (en_US) and the number contains
commas, the commas are treated as formatting symbols. If the locale relates to a country or
language that uses commas as a decimal separator, the comma is treated as a decimal point.

> #### Note
> The `parse()` method, found in various types, declares a checked
exception **ParseException** that must be handled or declared in the
method in which it is called.

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s look at an example. The following code parses a discounted ticket price with 
different locales. The `parse()` method throws a checked **ParseException**, so make sure to
handle or declare it in your own code.

```java
String s = "40.45";

var en = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.US);
System.out.println(en.parse(s)); // 40.45

var fr = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.FRANCE);
System.out.println(fr.parse(s)); // 4
```

&emsp;&emsp;
In the United States, a dot (.) is part of a number, and the number is parsed as you might
expect. France does not use a decimal point to separate numbers. Java parses it as a 
formatting character, and it stops looking at the rest of the number. The lesson is to make sure that
you parse using the right locale! <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The `parse()` method is also used for parsing currency. For example, we can read in the
zoo’s monthly income from ticket sales:

```java
String income = "$92,807.99";
var cf = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
double value = (Double) cf.parse(income);
System.out.println(value); // 92807.99
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The currency string "$92,807.99" contains a dollar sign and a comma. The parse
method strips out the characters and converts the value to a number. The return value of
parse is a **Number** object. **Number** is the parent class of all the **java.lang** wrapper classes,
so the return value can be cast to its appropriate data type. The **Number** is cast to a **Double**
and then automatically unboxed into a double.

### &emsp;&emsp; 3. Formatting with _CompactNumberFormat_
The second class that inherits **NumberFormat** that you need to know for the exam is
**CompactNumberFormat**. It is new to the Java 17 exam, so you’re likely to see a
question on it! <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
**CompactNumberFormat** is similar to **DecimalFormat**, but it is designed to be used in places
where print space may be limited. It is opinionated in the sense that it picks a format for
you, and locale-specific in that output can change depending on your location. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Consider the following sample code that applies a **CompactNumberFormat** five times to
two locales, using a static import for Style (an enum with value **SHORT** or **LONG**):

```java
var formatters = Stream.of(
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance(),
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance(Locale.getDefault(), Style.SHORT),
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance(Locale.getDefault(), Style.LONG),
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance(Locale.GERMAN, Style.SHORT),
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance(Locale.GERMAN, Style.LONG),
    NumberFormat.getNumberInstance());

formatters.map(s -> s.format(7_123_456)).forEach(System.out::println);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The following is printed by this code when run in the en_US locale (line breaks added for
readability):

```java
7M
7M
7 million

7 Mio.
7 Millionen

7,123,456
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Notice that the first two lines are the same. If you don’t specify a style, **SHORT** is used
by default. Next, notice that the values except the last one (which doesn’t use a compact
number formatter) are truncated. There’s a reason it’s called a compact number formatter!
Also, notice that the short form uses common labels for large values, such as K for 
thousand. Last but not least, the output may differ for you when you run this, as it was run in an
en_US locale. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Using the same formatters, let’s try another example:

```java
formatters.map(s -> s.format(314_900_000)).forEach(System.out::println);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This prints the following when run in the en_US locale:

```java
315M
315M
315 million

315 Mio.
315 Millionen

314,900,000
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Notice that the third digit is automatically rounded up for the entries that use a
**CompactNumberFormat**. The following summarizes the rules for **CompactNumberFormat**:
- First it determines the highest range for the number, such as thousand (K), million (M),
billion (B), or trillion (T).
- It then returns up to the first three digits of that range, rounding the last digit as needed.
- Finally, it prints an identifier. If **SHORT** is used, a symbol is returned. If **LONG** is used, a
space followed by a word is returned.

&emsp;&emsp;
For the exam, make sure you understand the difference between the **SHORT** and **LONG** 
formats and common symbols like M for million.

## III. Localizing Dates

Like numbers, date formats can vary by locale. Table 11.9 shows methods used to retrieve an
instance of a **DateTimeFormatter** using the default locale.

> **Table 11.9** Factory methods to get a **DateTimeFormatter**
> 
> |Description|**Using default** Locale|
> |---|---|
> |For formatting dates |DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDate(FormatStyle dateStyle)|
> |For formatting times |DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedTime(FormatStyle timeStyle)|
> |For formatting dates and times |DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDateTime(FormatStyle dateStyle, FormatStyle timeStyle)<br/>DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDateTime(FormatStyle dateTimeStyle)|

&emsp;&emsp;
Each method in the table takes a FormatStyle parameter (or two) with possible values
**SHORT**, **MEDIUM**, **LONG**, and **FULL**. For the exam, you are not required to know the format of
each of these styles. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
What if you need a formatter for a specific locale? Easy enough—just append
`withLocale(locale)` to the method call. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s put it all together. Take a look at the following code snippet, which relies on a
static import for the **java.time.format.FormatStyle.SHORT** value:

```java
public static void print(DateTimeFormatter dtf,
        LocalDateTime dateTime, Locale locale) {
    System.out.println(dtf.format(dateTime) + " --- "
        + dtf.withLocale(locale).format(dateTime));
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Locale.setDefault(new Locale("en", "US"));
    var italy = new Locale("it", "IT");
    var dt = LocalDateTime.of(2022, Month.OCTOBER, 20, 15, 12, 34);
    
    // 10/20/22 --- 20/10/22
    print(DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDate(SHORT),dt,italy);
    
    // 3:12 PM --- 15:12
    print(DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedTime(SHORT),dt,italy);
    
    // 10/20/22, 3:12 PM --- 20/10/22, 15:12
    print(DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDateTime(SHORT,SHORT),dt,italy);
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
First we establish en_US as the default locale, with it_IT as the requested locale. We
then output each value using the two locales. As you can see, applying a locale has a big
impact on the built-in date and time formatters.

## IV. Specifying a Locale Category
When you call `Locale.setDefault()` with a locale, several display and formatting
options are internally selected. If you require finer-grained control of the default locale,
Java subdivides the underlying formatting options into distinct categories with the
**Locale.Category** enum. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The **Locale.Category** enum is a nested element in Locale that supports distinct
locales for displaying and formatting data. For the exam, you should be familiar with the
two enum values in Table 11.10.

> **Table 11.10** Locale.Category values
> 
> |Value|Description|
> |---|---|
> |DISPLAY |Category used for displaying data about locale|
> |FORMAT |Category used for formatting dates, numbers, or currencies|

&emsp;&emsp;
When you call `Locale.setDefault()` with a locale, the **DISPLAY** and **FORMAT** are set
together. Let’s take a look at an example:

```java
10: public static void printCurrency(Locale locale, double money) {
11:     System.out.println(
12:         NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format(money)
13:         + ", " + locale.getDisplayLanguage());
14: }
15: public static void main(String[] args) {
16:     var spain = new Locale("es", "ES");
17:     var money = 1.23;
18:
19:     // Print with default locale
20:     Locale.setDefault(new Locale("en", "US"));
21:     printCurrency(spain, money); // $1.23, Spanish
22:
23:     // Print with selected locale display
24:     Locale.setDefault(Category.DISPLAY, spain);
25:     printCurrency(spain, money); // $1.23, español
26:
27:     // Print with selected locale format
28:     Locale.setDefault(Category.FORMAT, spain);
29:     printCurrency(spain, money); // 1,23 €, español
30: }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The code prints the same data three times. First it prints the language of the spain and
money variables using the locale **en_US**. Then it prints it using the **DISPLAY** category of
**es_ES**, while the **FORMAT** category remains **en_US**. Finally, it prints the data using 
both categories set to **es_ES**. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
For the exam, you do not need to memorize the various display and formatting options
for each category. You just need to know that you can set parts of the locale independently.
You should also know that calling `Locale.setDefault(us)` after the previous code 
snippet will change both locale categories to **en_US**.
