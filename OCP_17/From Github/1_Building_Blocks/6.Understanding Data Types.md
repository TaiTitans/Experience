# Understanding Data Types

Java applications contain two types of data: primitive types and reference types. In this 
section, we discuss the differences between a primitive type and a reference type.

## I. Using Primitive Types

Java has eight built-in data types, referred to as the Java _primitive types_. These eight data
types represent the building blocks for Java objects, because all Java objects are just a 
complex collection of these primitive data types. That said, a primitive is not an object in Java,
nor does it represent an object. A primitive is just a single value in memory, such as a number
or character.

### 1. The Primitive Types

The exam assumes you are well versed in the eight primitive data types, their relative sizes,
and what can be stored in them. Table 1.6 shows the Java primitive types together with their
size in bits and the range of values that each holds.

> **Table 1.6** Primitive types

|Keyword|Type|Min value|Max value|Default value| Example |
|-------|----|---------|---------|-------------|---------|
|boolean|true or false|N/A|N/A|false| true    |
|byte|8-bit integral value|-128|127|0| 123     |
|short|16-bit integral value|-32,768|32,767|0| 123     |
|int|32-bit integral value|-2,147,483,648|2,147,483,647|0| 123     |
|long|64-bit integral value|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808|9,223,372,036,854,775,807|0L| 123L    |
|float|32-bit floating-point value|N/A|N/A|0.0f| 123.45f |
|double|64-bit floating-point value|N/A|N/A|0.0d| 123.456 |
|char|16-bit Unicode value|'\u0000'|'\uffff'|'\u0000'| 'a'     |

> #### Is _String_ a Primitive?
> No, it is not. That said, `String` is often mistaken for a ninth primitive because Java
includes built-in support for `String` literals and operators. You learn more about `String` in
Chapter 4, but for now, just remember it’s an `object`, not a `primitive`.

&emsp;&emsp;
There’s a lot of information in Table 1.6. Let’s look at some key points:
- The `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long` types are used for integer values without decimal points.
- Each numeric type uses twice as many bits as the smaller similar type. For example,
`short` uses twice as many bits as `byte` does.
- All of the numeric types are signed and reserve one of their bits to cover a negative
range. For example, instead of byte covering 0 to 255 (or even 1 to 256) it actually
covers -128 to 127.
- A `float` requires the letter `f` or `F` following the number so Java knows it is a `float`.
Without an `f` or `F`, Java interprets a decimal value as a `double`.
- A `long` requires the letter `l` or `L` following the number so Java knows it is a `long`.
Without an `l` or `L`, Java interprets a number without a decimal point as an int in most
scenarios.

&emsp;&emsp;
You won’t be asked about the exact sizes of these types, although you should have a 
general idea of the size of smaller types like `byte` and `short`. A common question among newer
Java developers is, what is the bit size of boolean? The answer is, it is not specified and is
dependent on the JVM where the code is being executed.

> #### Signed and Unsigned: _short_ and _char_
> - For the exam, you should be aware that `short` and `char` are closely related, as both are
stored as integral types with the same 16-bit length. The primary difference is that `short`
is **signed**, which means it splits its range across the positive and negative integers. 
Alternatively, _char_ is **unsigned**, which means its range is strictly positive, including 0.
> - Often, `short` and `char` values can be cast to one another because the underlying data size
is the same. You learn more about casting in Chapter 2, “Operators.”

### 2. Writing Literals
There are a few more things you should know about numeric primitives. When a number is
present in the code, it is called a _literal_. By default, Java assumes you are defining an `int` value
with a numeric literal. In the following example, the number listed is bigger than what fits in
an `int`. Remember, you aren’t expected to memorize the maximum value for an `int`. The exam
will include it in the question if it comes up.

```java
long max = 3123456789; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Java complains the number is out of range. And it is—for an `int`. However, we don’t
have an `int`. The solution is to add the character `L` to the number:

```java
long max = 3123456789L; // Now Java knows it’s a long
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Alternatively, you could add a lowercase `l` to the number. But please use the uppercase `L`.
The lowercase `l` looks like the number `1`. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Another way to specify numbers is to change the “base.” When you learned how to count,
you studied the digits 0–9. This numbering system is called `base 10` since there are 10 
possible values for each digit. It is also known as the `decimal number system`. Java allows you to
specify digits in several other formats:

- Octal (digits 0–7), which uses the number 0 as a prefix—for example, 017.
- Hexadecimal (digits 0–9 and letters A–F/a–f), which uses 0x or 0X as a prefix—for
example, 0xFF, 0xff, 0XFf. Hexadecimal is case insensitive, so all of these examples
mean the same value.
- Binary (digits 0–1), which uses the number 0 followed by b or B as a prefix—for
example, 0b10, 0B10.

You won’t need to convert between number systems on the exam. You’ll have to 
recognize valid literal values that can be assigned to numbers.

### 3. Literals and the Underscore Character
The last thing you need to know about numeric literals is that you can have underscores in
numbers to make them easier to read:

```java
int million1 = 1000000;
int million2 = 1_000_000;
```

&emsp;&emsp;
We’d rather be reading the latter one because the zeros don’t run together. You can add
underscores anywhere except at the beginning of a literal, the end of a literal, right before a
decimal point, or right after a decimal point. You can even place multiple underscore 
characters next to each other, although we don’t recommend it. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s look at a few examples:

```java
double notAtStart       = _1000.00;           // DOES NOT COMPILE
double notAtEnd         = 1000.00_;           // DOES NOT COMPILE
double notByDecimal     = 1000_.00;           // DOES NOT COMPILE
double annoyingButLegal = 1_00_0.0_0;         // Ugly, but compiles
double reallyUgly       = 1__________2;       // Also compiles
```

## II. Using Reference Types
A _reference type_ refers to an object (an instance of a class). Unlike primitive types that hold
their values in the memory where the variable is allocated, references do not hold the value
of the object they refer to. Instead, a reference “points” to an object by storing the memory
address where the object is located, a concept referred to as a _pointer_. Unlike other 
languages, Java does not allow you to learn what the physical memory address is. You can only
use the reference to refer to the object. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s take a look at some examples that declare and initialize reference types. Suppose we
declare a reference of type `String`:

```java
String greeting;
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The `greeting` variable is a reference that can only point to a String object. A value is
assigned to a reference in one of two ways:

- A reference can be assigned to another object of the same or compatible type.
- A reference can be assigned to a new object using the new keyword.

&emsp;&emsp;
For example, the following statement assigns this reference to a new object:

```java
greeting = new String("How are you?");
```

The greeting reference points to a new `String` object, "How are you?". The `String`
object does not have a name and can be accessed only via a corresponding reference.

## III. Distinguishing between Primitives and Reference Types
There are a few important differences you should know between primitives and reference
types. First, notice that all the primitive types have lowercase type names. All classes that
come with Java begin with uppercase. Although not required, it is a standard practice, and
you should follow this convention for classes you create as well. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Next, reference types can be used to call methods, assuming the reference is not **null**.
Primitives do not have methods declared on them. In this example, we can call a method on
`reference` since it is of a reference type. You can tell `length` is a method because it has `()` after
it. See if you can understand why the following snippet does not compile:

```java
4:  String reference = "hello";
5:  int len = reference.length();
6:  int bad = len.length(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Line 6 is gibberish. No methods exist on `len` because it is an `int` primitive. Primitives
do not have methods. Remember, a String is not a primitive, so you can call methods like
`length()` on a `String` reference, as we did on line 5. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Finally, reference types can be assigned `null`, which means they do not currently refer to
an object. Primitive types will give you a compiler error if you attempt to assign them `null`. In
this example, value cannot point to `null` because it is of type `int`:

```java
int value = null; // DOES NOT COMPILE
String name = null;
```

&emsp;&emsp;
But what if you don’t know the value of an int and want to assign it to null? In that
case, you should use a **numeric wrapper class**, such as `Integer`, instead of int.

## IV. Creating Wrapper Classes

Each primitive type has a wrapper class, which is an object type that corresponds to the
primitive. Table 1.7 lists all the wrapper classes along with how to create them.

> #### Table 1.7 Wrapper classes

|Primitive type|Wrapper class|Wrapper class inherits Number?| Example of creating        |
|--------------|-------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
|boolean|Boolean|No| Boolean.valueOf(true)      |
|byte|Byte|Yes| Byte.valueOf((byte) 123)   |
|short|Short|Yes| Short.valueOf((short) 123) |
|int|Integer|Yes| Integer.valueOf(123)       |
|long|Long|Yes| Long.valueOf(123)          |
|float|Float|Yes| Float.valueOf((float) 1.0) |
|double|Double|Yes| Double.valueOf(1.0)        |
|char|Character|No| Character.valueOf('a')     |

&emsp;&emsp;
There is also a `valueOf()` variant that converts a `String` into the wrapper class.
For example:

```java
int primitive = Integer.parseInt("123");
Integer wrapper = Integer.valueOf("123");
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first line converts a `String` to an `int` primitive. The second converts a `String` to an
`Integer` wrapper class. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
All of the numeric classes in Table 1.7 extend the `Number` class, which means they all
come with some useful helper methods: `byteValue()`, `shortValue()`, `intValue()`,
`longValue()`, `floatValue()`, and `doubleValue()`. The `Boolean` and `Character`
wrapper classes include `booleanValue()` and `charValue()`, respectively. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
As you probably guessed, these methods return the primitive value of a wrapper instance,
in the type requested.

```java
Double apple = Double.valueOf("200.99");
System.out.println(apple.byteValue());      // -56
System.out.println(apple.intValue());       // 200
System.out.println(apple.doubleValue());    // 200.99
```

&emsp;&emsp;
These helper methods do their best to convert values but can result in a loss of 
precision. In the first example, there is no `200` in `byte`, so it wraps around to `-56`. In the 
second example, the value is truncated, which means all of the numbers after the decimal are
dropped. In Chapter 5, we apply autoboxing and unboxing to show how easy Java makes it
to work with primitive and wrapper values. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Some of the wrapper classes contain additional helper methods for working with 
numbers. You don’t need to memorize these; you can assume any you are given are valid. For
example, `Integer` has:

- `max(int num1, int num2)`, which returns the largest of the two numbers
- `min(int num1, int num2)`, which returns the smallest of the two numbers
- `sum(int num1, int num2)`, which adds the two numbers

## V. Defining Text Blocks
Earlier we saw a simple `String` with the value "hello". What if we want to have a `String`
with something more complicated? For example, let’s figure out how to create a `String`
with this value:

```java
"Java Study Guide"
    by Scott & Jeanne
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Building this as a `String` requires two things you haven’t learned yet. The syntax `\"` lets
you say you want a `"` rather than to end the `String`, and `\n `says you want a new line. Both
of these are called _escape characters_ because the backslash provides a special meaning. With
these two new skills, we can write

```java
String eyeTest = "\"Java Study Guide\"\n    by Scott & Jeanne";
```

&emsp;&emsp;
While this does work, it is hard to read. Luckily, Java has _text blocks_, also known as
multiline strings. See Figure 1.3 for the text block equivalent.

> #### Figure 1.3 Text block

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter1/unit6/figure1.3.png" alt="Figure 1.3 Text Block" style="width:300px;"/>

&emsp;&emsp;
A text block starts and ends with three double quotes `"""`, and the contents don’t need
to be escaped. This is much easier to read. Notice how the type is still `String`. This means
the methods you learn about in Chapter 4 for String work for both a regular `String` and
a text block. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
You might have noticed the words `incidental` and `essential whitespace` in the figure.
What’s that? `Essential whitespace` is part of your `String` and is important to you. `Incidental
whitespace` just happens to be there to make the code easier to read. You can reformat
your code and change the amount of incidental whitespace without any impact on your
`String` value. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Imagine a vertical line drawn on the leftmost non-whitespace character in your text
block. Everything to the left of it is incidental whitespace, and everything to the right is
essential whitespace. Let’s try an example. How many lines does this output, and how many
incidental and essential whitespace characters begin each line?

```java
14: String pyramid = """
15:   *
16:  * *
17: * * *
18: """;
19: System.out.print(pyramid);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
There are four lines of output. Lines 15–17 have stars. Line 18 is a line without any 
characters. The closing triple " would have needed to be on line 17 if we didn’t want that blank
line. There are no incidental whitespace characters here. The closing `"""` on line 18 are the
leftmost characters, so the line is drawn at the leftmost position. Line 15 has two essential
whitespace characters to begin the line, and line 16 has one. That whitespace fills in the line
drawn to match line 18. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Table 1.8 shows some special formatting sequences and compares how they work in a
regular `String` and a text block.

> #### Table 1.8 Text block formatting

| Formatting |Meaning in regular String|Meaning in text block|
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| \"|"|"|
|\"""|n/a - Invalid|"""|
|\"\"\"|"""|"""|
|Space (at end of line)|Space|Ignored|
|\s|Two spaces (\s is a space and preserves leading space on the line)|Two spaces|
|\ (at end of line)|n/a - Invalid|Omits new line o that line|

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s try a few examples. First, do you see why this doesn’t compile?

```java
String block = """doe"""; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Text blocks require a line break after the opening `"""`, making this one invalid. Now let’s
try a valid one. How many lines do you think are in this text block?

```java
String block = """
    doe \n
    deer""";
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Just one. The output is doe deer since the `\` tells Java not to add a new line before deer.
Let’s try determining the number of lines in another text block:

```java
String block = """
    doe \n
    deer
    """;
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This time we have four lines. Since the text block has the closing `"""` on a separate line,
we have three lines for the lines in the text block plus the explicit `\n`. Let’s try one more.
What do you think this outputs?

```java
String block = """
    "doe\"\"\"
    \"deer\"""
    """;
System.out.print("*" + block + "*");
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The answer is

```java
* "doe"""
 "deer"""
*
```

&emsp;&emsp;
All of the `\"` escape the `"`. There is one space of essential whitespace on the doe and deer
lines. All the other leading whitespace is incidental whitespace.
