# Destroying Objects

Now that we’ve played with our objects, it is time to put them away. Luckily, the JVM takes
care of that for you. Java provides a garbage collector to automatically look for objects that
aren’t needed anymore. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Remember, your code isn’t the only process running in your Java program. Java code
exists inside of a JVM, which includes numerous processes independent from your
application code. One of the most important of those is a built-in garbage collector. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
All Java objects are stored in your program memory’s _heap_. The heap, which is also
referred to as the _free store_, represents a large pool of unused memory allocated to your Java
application. If your program keeps instantiating objects and leaving them on the heap, 
eventually it will run out of memory and crash. Oh, no! Luckily, garbage collection solves this
problem. In the following sections, we look at garbage collection.

## I. Understanding Garbage Collection
_Garbage collection_ refers to the process of automatically freeing memory on the heap by
deleting objects that are no longer reachable in your program. There are many different 
algorithms for garbage collection, but you don’t need to know any of them for the exam. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
As a developer, the most interesting part of garbage collection is determining when the
memory belonging to an object can be reclaimed. In Java and other languages, _eligible for
garbage collection_ refers to an object’s state of no longer being accessible in a program and
therefore able to be garbage collected. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Does this mean an object that’s eligible for garbage collection will be immediately garbage
collected? Definitely not. When the object actually is discarded is not under your control, but
for the exam, you will need to know at any given moment which objects are eligible for garbage collection. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Think of garbage-collection eligibility like shipping a package. You can take an item, seal
it in a labeled box, and put it in your mailbox. This is analogous to making an item eligible
for garbage collection. When the mail carrier comes by to pick it up, though, is not in your
control. For example, it may be a postal holiday, or there could be a severe weather event.
You can even call the post office and ask them to come pick it up right away, but there’s no
way to guarantee when and if this will actually happen. Hopefully, they will come by before
your mailbox fills with packages! <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Java includes a built-in method to help support garbage collection where you can suggest
that garbage collection run.

```java
System.gc();
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Just like the post office, Java is free to ignore you. This method is _not guaranteed_ to
do anything.

## II. Tracing Eligibility
How does the JVM know when an object is eligible for garbage collection? The JVM waits
patiently and monitors each object until it determines that the code no longer needs that
memory. An object will remain on the heap until it is no longer reachable. An object is no
longer reachable when one of two situations occurs:

- The object no longer has any references pointing to it.
- All references to the object have gone out of scope.

> ### Objects vs. References
> Do not confuse a reference with the object that it refers to; they are two different entities.
The reference is a variable that has a name and can be used to access the contents of an
object. A reference can be assigned to another reference, passed to a method, or returned
from a method. All references are the same size, no matter what their type is. <br /><br />
> An object sits on the heap and does not have a name. Therefore, you have no way to access
an object except through a reference. Objects come in all different shapes and sizes and
consume varying amounts of memory. An object cannot be assigned to another object, and
an object cannot be passed to a method or returned from a method. It is the object that gets
garbage collected, not its reference.

&emsp;&emsp;
Realizing the difference between a reference and an object goes a long way toward 
understanding garbage collection, the new operator, and many other facets of the Java language.
Look at this code and see whether you can figure out when each object first becomes eligible
for garbage collection:

```java
1:  public class Scope {
2:      public static void main(String[] args) {
3:          String one, two;
4:          one = new String("a");
5:          two = new String("b");
6:          one = two;
7:          String three = one;
8:          one = null;
9:      } 
10: }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
When you are asked a question about garbage collection on the exam, we recommend
that you draw what’s going on. There’s a lot to keep track of in your head, and it’s easy to
make a silly mistake trying to hold it all in your memory. Let’s try it together now. Really.
Get a pencil and paper. We’ll wait. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Got that paper? Okay, let’s get started. On line 3, write `one` and `two` (just the words—no
need for boxes or arrows since no objects have gone on the heap yet). On line 4, we have our
first object. Draw a box with the string `"a"` in it, and draw an arrow from the word one to
that box. Line 5 is similar. Draw another box with the string `"b"` in it this time and an arrow
from the word two. At this point, your work should look like Figure 1.4.

&emsp;&emsp;
On line 6, the variable one changes to point to `"b"`. Either erase or cross out the arrow
from one and draw a new arrow from one to `"b"`. On line 7, we have a new variable, so
write the word `three` and draw an arrow from three to `"b"`. Notice that three points to
what one is pointing to right now and not what it was pointing to at the beginning. This
is why you are drawing pictures. It’s easy to forget something like that. At this point, your
work should look like Figure 1.5. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Finally, cross out the line between one and `"b"` since line 8 sets this variable to `null`.
Now, we were trying to find out when the objects were first eligible for garbage collection.
On line 6, we got rid of the only arrow pointing to `"a"`, making that object eligible for 
garbage collection. `"b"` has arrows pointing to it until it goes out of scope. This means `"b"`
doesn’t go out of scope until the end of the method on line 9.

> ### Code Formatting on the Exam
> Not all questions will include package declarations and imports. Don’t worry about missing
package statements or imports unless you are asked about them. The following are
common cases where you don’t need to check the imports:
> - Code that begins with a class name
> - Code that begins with a method declaration
> - Code that begins with a code snippet that would normally be inside a class or method
> - Code that has line numbers that don’t begin with 1
> 
> You’ll see code that doesn’t have a method. When this happens, assume any necessary
plumbing code like the `main()` method and class definition were written correctly. You’re
just being asked if the part of the code you’re shown compiles when dropped into valid 
surrounding code. Finally, remember that extra whitespace doesn’t matter in Java syntax. The
exam may use varying amounts of whitespace to trick you.
