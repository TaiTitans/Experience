# Creating a Service
In this section, you learn how to create a service. A _service_ is composed of an interface, any
classes the interface references, and a way of looking up implementations of the interface.
The implementations are not part of the service. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We will be using a tour application in the services section. It has four modules shown in
Figure 12.13. In this example, the **zoo.tours.api** and **zoo.tours.reservations** modules 
make up the service since they consist of the interface and lookup functionality

> **Figure 12.13** Modules in the tour application

> #### Note:
> You aren’t required to have four separate modules. We do so to illustrate
the concepts. For example, the service provider interface and service
locator could be in the same module.

# I. Declaring the Service Provider Interface
First, the **zoo.tours.api** module defines a Java object called **Souvenir**. It is considered
part of the service because it will be referenced by the interface.

```java
// Souvenir.java
package zoo.tours.api;

public record Souvenir(String description) { }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Next, the module contains a Java **interface** type. This interface is called the _service
provider interface_ because it specifies what behavior our service will have. In this case, it is a
simple API with three methods.

```java
// Tour.java
package zoo.tours.api;

public interface Tour {
    String name();
    int length();
    Souvenir getSouvenir();
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
All three methods use the implicit **public** modifier. Since we are working with 
modules, we also need to create a **module-info.java** file so our module definition exports the
package containing the interface.

```java
// module-info.java
module zoo.tours.api {
    exports zoo.tours.api;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Now that we have both files, we can compile and package this module.

```shell
javac -d serviceProviderInterfaceModule
    serviceProviderInterfaceModule/zoo/tours/api/*.java
    serviceProviderInterfaceModule/module-info.java
    
jar -cvf mods/zoo.tours.api.jar -C serviceProviderInterfaceModule/ .
```

> #### Note
> A service provider “interface” can be an **abstract** class rather than an
actual **interface**. Since you will only see it as an **interface** on the
exam, we use that term in the book.

&emsp;&emsp;
To review, the service includes the service provider interface and supporting classes it 
references. The service also includes the lookup functionality, which we define next.

## II. Creating a Service Locator
To complete our service, we need a service locator. A _service locator_ can find any classes that
implement a service provider interface. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Luckily, Java provides a **ServiceLoader** class to help with this task. You pass the service
provider interface type to its `load()` method, and Java will return any implementation services
it can find. The following class shows it in action:

```java
// TourFinder.java
package zoo.tours.reservations;

import java.util.*;
import zoo.tours.api.*;

public class TourFinder {
    public static Tour findSingleTour() {
        ServiceLoader<Tour> loader = ServiceLoader.load(Tour.class);
        for (Tour tour : loader)
            return tour;
        return null;
 }
 public static List<Tour> findAllTours() {
    List<Tour> tours = new ArrayList<>();
        ServiceLoader<Tour> loader = ServiceLoader.load(Tour.class);
        for (Tour tour : loader)
        tours.add(tour);
    return tours;
    }
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
As you can see, we provided two lookup methods. The first is a convenience method if
you are expecting exactly one **Tour** to be returned. The other returns a **List**, which 
accommodates any number of service providers. At runtime, there may be many service providers
(or none) that are found by the service locator.

> #### Tip
> The **ServiceLoader** call is relatively expensive. If you are writing a real
application, it is best to cache the result.

&emsp;&emsp;
Our module definition exports the package with the lookup class **TourFinder**. It
requires the service provider interface package. It also has the uses directive since it will be
looking up a service.

```java
// module-info.java
module zoo.tours.reservations {
    exports zoo.tours.reservations;
    requires zoo.tours.api;
    uses zoo.tours.api.Tour;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Remember that both **requires** and **uses** are needed, one for compilation and one for
lookup. Finally, we compile and package the module.

```shell
javac -p mods -d serviceLocatorModule
    serviceLocatorModule/zoo/tours/reservations/*.java
    serviceLocatorModule/module-info.java
    
jar -cvf mods/zoo.tours.reservations.jar -C serviceLocatorModule/ .
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Now that we have the interface and lookup logic, we have completed our service.

> #### Using _ServiceLoader_
> There are two methods in ServiceLoader that you need to know for the exam. The 
declaration is as follows, sans the full implementation:
> ```java
>   public final class ServiceLoader<S> implements Iterable<S> {
>       public static <S> ServiceLoader<S> load(Class<S> service) { ... }
>       public Stream<Provider<S>> stream() { ... }
>       // Additional methods
>   }
> ```
> As we already saw, calling `ServiceLoader.load()` returns an object that you can loop
through normally. However, requesting a **Stream** gives you a different type. The reason for
this is that a **Stream** controls when elements are evaluated. Therefore, a **ServiceLoader**
returns a **Stream** of **Provider** objects. You have to call `get()` to retrieve the value you
wanted out of each **Provider**, such as in this example:
> ```java
> ServiceLoader.load(Tour.class)
>       .stream()
>       .map(Provider::get)
>       .mapToInt(Tour::length)
>       .max()
>       .ifPresent(System.out::println);
> ```

## III. Invoking from a Consumer
Next up is to call the service locator by a consumer. A _consumer_ (or _client_) refers to a
module that obtains and uses a service. Once the consumer has acquired a service via the 
service locator, it is able to invoke the methods provided by the service provider interface.

```java
// Tourist.java
package zoo.visitor;

import java.util.*;
import zoo.tours.api.*;
import zoo.tours.reservations.*;

public class Tourist {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Tour tour = TourFinder.findSingleTour();
        System.out.println("Single tour: " + tour);
        
        List<Tour> tours = TourFinder.findAllTours();
        System.out.println("# tours: " + tours.size());
    }
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Our module definition doesn’t need to know anything about the implementations since
the **zoo.tours.reservations** module is handling the lookup.

```java
// module-info.java
module zoo.visitor {
    requires zoo.tours.api;
    requires zoo.tours.reservations;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This time, we get to run a program after compiling and packaging.

```shell
javac -p mods -d consumerModule
    consumerModule/zoo/visitor/*.java consumerModule/module-info.java

jar -cvf mods/zoo.visitor.jar -C consumerModule/ .

java -p mods -m zoo.visitor/zoo.visitor.Tourist
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The program outputs the following:

```
Single tour: null
# tours: 0
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Well, that makes sense. We haven’t written a class that implements the interface yet.

## IV. Adding a Service Provider
A _service provider_ is the implementation of a service provider interface. As we said earlier,
at runtime it is possible to have multiple implementation classes or modules. We will stick to
one here for simplicity. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Our service provider is the **zoo.tours.agency** package because we’ve outsourced the
running of tours to a third party.

```java
// TourImpl.java
package zoo.tours.agency;

import zoo.tours.api.*;

public class TourImpl implements Tour {
    public String name() {
        return "Behind the Scenes";
    }
    public int length() {
        return 120;
    }
    public Souvenir getSouvenir() {
        return new Souvenir("stuffed animal");
    }
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Again, we need a **module-info.java** file to create a module.

```java
// module-info.java
module zoo.tours.agency {
    requires zoo.tours.api;
    provides zoo.tours.api.Tour with zoo.tours.agency.TourImpl;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The module declaration requires the module containing the interface as a dependency.
We don’t export the package that implements the interface since we don’t want callers referring 
to it directly. Instead, we use the **provides** directive. This allows us to specify that we
provide an implementation of the interface with a specific implementation class. The syntax
looks like this:

```java
provides interfaceName with className;
```

> #### Note
> We have not exported the package containing the implementation.
Instead, we have made the implementation available to a service provider
using the interface.

&emsp;&emsp;
Finally, we compile it and package it up.

```shell
javac -p mods -d serviceProviderModule
    serviceProviderModule/zoo/tours/agency/*.java
    serviceProviderModule/module-info.java
jar -cvf mods/zoo.tours.agency.jar -C serviceProviderModule/ .
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Now comes the cool part. We can run the Java program again.

```shell
java -p mods -m zoo.visitor/zoo.visitor.Tourist
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This time, we see the following output:

```
Single tour: zoo.tours.agency.TourImpl@1936f0f5
# tours: 1
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Notice how we didn’t recompile the **zoo.tours.reservations** or **zoo.visitor**
package. The service locator was able to observe that there was now a service provider
implementation available and find it for us. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
This is useful when you have functionality that changes independently of the rest of the
code base. For example, you might have custom reports or logging.

> #### Note
> In software development, the concept of separating different components 
into stand-alone pieces is referred to as _loose coupling_. One
advantage of loosely coupled code is that it can be easily swapped out or
replaced with minimal (or zero) changes to code that uses it. Relying on a
loosely coupled structure allows service modules to be easily extensible
at runtime.

## V. Reviewing Directives and Services
Table 12.4 summarizes what we’ve covered in the section about services. We recommend
learning really well what is needed when each artifact is in a separate module. That is most
likely what you will see on the exam and will ensure that you understand the concepts.
Table 12.5 lists all the directives you need to know for the exam.

> **Table 12.4** Reviewing services
> 
> |Artifact|Part of the service|Directives required|
> |--------|-------------------|-------------------|
> |Service provider interface |Yes |exports|
> |Service provider |No |requires<br/>provides|
> |Service locator |Yes |exports<br/>requires<br/>uses|
> |Consumer |No |requires|


> **Table 12.5** Reviewing directives
> 
> |Directive|Description|
> |---------|-----------|
> |**exports** _package_**;**<br />**exports** _package_ **to** _module_**;** |Makes package available outside module|
> |**requires** _module_**;**<br/>**requires transitive** _module_**;** |Specifies another module as dependency|
> |**opens** _package_**;**<br />**opens** _package_ **to** _module_**;** |Allows package to be used with reflection|
> |**provides** _serviceInterface_ **with** _implName_**;** |Makes service available|
> |**uses** _serviceInterface_**;** |References service|
