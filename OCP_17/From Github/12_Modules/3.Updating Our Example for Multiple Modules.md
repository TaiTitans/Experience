# Updating Our Example for Multiple Modules

Now that our **zoo.animal.feeding** module is solid, we can start thinking about our other
modules. As you can see in Figure 12.6, all three of the other modules in our system depend
on the **zoo.animal.feeding** module.

# I. Updating the Feeding Module

Since we will be having our other modules call code in the **zoo.animal.feeding package**,
we need to declare this intent in the module declaration. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The exports directive is used to indicate that a module intends for those packages to be
used by Java code outside the module. As you might expect, without an **exports** directive,
the module is only available to be run from the command line on its own. In the following
example, we export one package:

```java
module zoo.animal.feeding {
    exports zoo.animal.feeding;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Recompiling and repackaging the module will update the **module-info.class** inside
our **zoo.animal.feeding.jar** file. These are the same javac and jar commands you ran
previously:

```bash
javac -p mods
    -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/*.java feeding/module-info.java

jar -cvf mods/zoo.animal.feeding.jar -C feeding/ .
```

## II. Creating a Care Module
Next, let’s create the **zoo.animal.care** module. This time, we are going to have two 
packages. The **zoo.animal.care.medical** package will have the classes and methods that are
intended for use by other modules. The **zoo.animal.care.details** package is only going
to be used by this module. It will not be exported from the module. Think of it as healthcare
privacy for the animals. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Figure 12.7 shows the contents of this module. Remember that all modules must have a
module-info.java file.

> **Figure 12.7** Contents of zoo.animal.care

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter12/unit3/figure12.7.png" alt="Figure 12.7" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
The module contains two basic packages and classes in addition to the
**module-info.java** file:

```java
// HippoBirthday.java
package zoo.animal.care.details;
import zoo.animal.feeding.*;
public class HippoBirthday {
    private Task task;
}

// Diet.java
package zoo.animal.care.medical;
public class Diet { }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This time the **module-info.java** file specifies three things:

```
1:  module zoo.animal.care {
2:      exports zoo.animal.care.medical;
3:      requires zoo.animal.feeding;
4:  }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Line 1 specifies the name of the module. Line 2 lists the package we are exporting so it
can be used by other modules. So far, this is similar to the **zoo.animal.feeding** module. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
On line 3, we see a new directive. The requires statement specifies that a module is
needed. The **zoo.animal.care** module depends on the **zoo.animal.feeding** module. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Next, we need to figure out the directory structure. We will create two packages. The
first is **zoo.animal.care.details** and contains one class named **HippoBirthday**. The
second is **zoo.animal.care.medical**, which contains one class named **Diet**. Try to draw
the directory structure on paper or create it on your computer. If you are trying to run these
examples without using the online code, just create classes without variables or methods for
everything except the **module-info.java** files. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
You might have noticed that the packages begin with the same prefix as the module name.
This is intentional. You can think of it as if the module name “claims” the matching package
and all subpackages. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
To review, we now compile and package the module:

```bash
javac -p mods
    -d care
    care/zoo/animal/care/details/*.java
    care/zoo/animal/care/medical/*.java
    care/module-info.java
```

&emsp;&emsp;
We compile both packages and the module-info.java file. In the real world, you’ll use
a build tool rather than doing this by hand. For the exam, you just list all the packages
and/or files you want to compile. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Now that we have compiled code, it’s time to create the module **JAR**:

```bash
jar -cvf mods/zoo.animal.care.jar -C care/ .
```

## III. Creating the Talks Module
So far, we’ve used only one exports and requires statement in a module. Now you’ll
learn how to handle exporting multiple packages or requiring multiple modules. In
Figure 12.8, observe that the **zoo.animal.talks** module depends on two modules:
z**oo.animal.feeding** and **zoo.animal.care**. This means that there must be two
requires statements in the **module-info.java** file.

> **Figure 12.8** Dependencies for **zoo.animal.talks**

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter12/unit3/figure12.8.png" alt="Figure 12.8" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
Figure 12.9 shows the contents of this module. We are going to export all three packages
in this module.

> **Figure 12.9** Contents of **zoo.animal.talks**

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter12/unit3/figure12.9.png" alt="Figure 12.9" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
First let’s look at the **module-info.java** file for **zoo.animal.talks**:

```
1:  module zoo.animal.talks {
2:      exports zoo.animal.talks.content;
3:      exports zoo.animal.talks.media;
4:      exports zoo.animal.talks.schedule;
5:
6:      requires zoo.animal.feeding;
7:      requires zoo.animal.care;
8:  }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Line 1 shows the module name. Lines 2–4 allow other modules to reference all three
packages. Lines 6 and 7 specify the two modules that this module depends on. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Then we have the six classes, as shown here:

```java
// ElephantScript.java
package zoo.animal.talks.content;
public class ElephantScript { }

// SeaLionScript.java
package zoo.animal.talks.content;
public class SeaLionScript { }

// Announcement.java
package zoo.animal.talks.media;
public class Announcement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("We will be having talks");
    }
}

// Signage.java
package zoo.animal.talks.media;
public class Signage { }

// Weekday.java
package zoo.animal.talks.schedule;
public class Weekday { }

// Weekend.java
package zoo.animal.talks.schedule;
public class Weekend {}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
If you are still following along on your computer, create these classes in the packages. The
following are the commands to compile and build the module:

```bash
javac -p mods
    -d talks
    talks/zoo/animal/talks/content/*.java talks/zoo/animal/talks/media/*.java
    talks/zoo/animal/talks/schedule/*.java talks/module-info.java

jar -cvf mods/zoo.animal.talks.jar -C talks/ .
```

## IV. Creating the Staff Module

Our final module is zoo.staff. Figure 12.10 shows that there is only one package inside.
We will not be exposing this package outside the module.

> **Figure 12.10** Contents of zoo.staff

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter12/unit3/figure12.10.png" alt="Figure 12.10" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
Based on Figure 12.11, do you know what should go in the **module-info**?

> **Figure 12.11** Dependencies for zoo.staff

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter12/unit3/figure12.11.png" alt="Figure 12.11" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
There are three arrows in Figure 12.11 pointing from **zoo.staff** to other modules.
These represent the three modules that are required. Since no packages are to be exposed
from **zoo.staff**, there are no exports statements. This gives us:

```java
module zoo.staff {
    requires zoo.animal.feeding;
    requires zoo.animal.care;
    requires zoo.animal.talks;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
In this module, we have a single class in the Jobs.java file:

```java
package zoo.staff;
public class Jobs { }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
For those of you following along on your computer, create a class in the package. 
The following are the commands to compile and build the module:

```bash
javac -p mods
    -d staff
    staff/zoo/staff/*.java staff/module-info.java
    
jar -cvf mods/zoo.staff.jar -C staff/ .
```
