# Creating and Running a Modular Program

n this section, we create, build, and run the zoo.animal.feeding module. We chose this
one to start with because all the other modules depend on it. Figure 12.3 shows the design
of this module. In addition to the **module-info.java** file, it has one package with one
class inside.

&emsp;&emsp;
In the next sections, we create, compile, run, and package the **zoo.animal.feeding** module.

## I. Creating the Files
First we have a really simple class that prints one line in a `main()` method. We know, that’s
not much of an implementation. All those programmers we hired can fill it in with business
logic. In this book, we focus on what you need to know for the exam. So, let’s create a
simple class.

```java
package zoo.animal.feeding;

public class Task {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        System.out.println("All fed!");
    }
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Next comes the **module-info.java** file. This is the simplest possible one:

```java
module zoo.animal.feeding {
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
There are a few key differences between a module declaration and a regular Java class
declaration:
- The module-info.java file must be in the root directory of your module. Regular
Java classes should be in packages.
- The module declaration must use the keyword module instead of class, interface, or enum.
- The module name follows the naming rules for package names. It often includes periods
(.) in its name. Regular class and package names are not allowed to have dashes (-).
Module names follow the same rule. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
That’s a lot of rules for the simplest possible file. There will be many more rules when we
flesh out this file later in the chapter. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The next step is to make sure the files are in the right directory structure. Figure 12.4
shows the expected directory structure.

> **Figure 12.4** Module zoo.animal.feeding directory structure

&emsp;&emsp;
In particular, feeding is the module directory, and the **module-info.java** file is
directly under it. Just as with a regular JAR file, we also have the **zoo.animal.feeding**
package with one subfolder per portion of the name. The Task class is in the appropriate
subfolder for its package. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Also, note that we created a directory called mods at the same level as the module. We
use it to store the module artifacts a little later in the chapter. This directory can be named
anything, but mods is a common name. If you are following along with the online code
example, note that the mods directory is not included, because it is empty.

## II. Compiling Our First Module
Before we can run modular code, we need to compile it. Other than the module-path
option, this code should look familiar from Chapter 1:

```java
javac --module-path mods
    -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/*.java feeding/module-info.java
```

> #### Note
> When you’re entering commands at the command line, they should be
typed all on one line. We use line breaks in the book to make the 
commands easier to read and study. If you want to use multiple lines at the
command prompt, the approach varies by operating system. Linux uses a
backslash (\) to escape the line break.

As a review, the -d option specifies the directory to place the class files in. The end of the
command is a list of the .java files to compile. You can list the files individually or use a
wildcard for all .java files in a subdirectory. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The new part is module-path. This option indicates the location of any custom module
files. In this example, module-path could have been omitted since there are no 
dependencies. You can think of module-path as replacing the classpath option when you are
working on a modular program. 

> #### What about the classpath?
> The **classpath** option has three possible forms: **-cp**, **--class-path**, and **-classpath**.
You can still use these options. In fact, it is common to do so when writing nonmodular programs.

Just like classpath, you can use an abbreviation in the command. The syntax
**--module-path** and **-p** are equivalent. That means we could have written many other
commands in place of the previous command. The following four commands show the
**-p** option:

```
javac -p mods -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/*.java feeding/*.java
    
javac -p mods -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/*.java feeding/module-info.java
    
javac -p mods -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/Task.java feeding/module-info.java
    
javac -p mods -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/Task.java feeding/*.java
```

&emsp;&emsp;
While you can use whichever you like best, be sure that you can recognize all valid forms
for the exam. Table 12.1 lists the options you need to know well when compiling modules.
There are many more options you can pass to the **javac** command, but these are the ones
you can expect to be tested on.

> **Table 12.1** Options you need to know for using modules with **javac**
> 
> |Use for|Abbreviation|Long form|
> |-------|------------|---------|
> |Directory for class files |-d <dir> |n/a|
> |Module path |-p <path> |--module-path <path>|

> ### Real World Scenario
> #### Building Modules
> Even without modules, it is rare to run **javac** and **java** commands manually on a real
project. They get long and complicated very quickly. Most developers use a build tool such
as **Maven** or **Gradle**. These build tools suggest directories in which to place the class files,
like **target/classes**. <br /><br />
> It is likely that the only time you need to know the syntax of these commands is when you
take the exam. The concepts themselves are useful, regardless. <br /><br />
> Be sure to memorize the module command syntax. You will be tested on it on the exam. We
give you lots of practice questions on the syntax to reinforce it.

## III. Running Our First Module
Before we package our module, we should make sure it works by running it. To do that,
we need to learn the full syntax. Suppose there is a module named **book.module**. Inside
that module is a package named **com.sybex**, which has a class named OCP with a `main()`
method. Figure 12.5 shows the syntax for running a module. Pay special attention to the
**book.module/com.sybex.OCP** part. It is important to remember that you specify the
module name followed by a slash (/) followed by the fully qualified class name.

> **Figure 12.5** Running a module using java

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter12/unit2/figure12.5.png" alt="Figure 12.5" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
Now that we’ve seen the syntax, we can write the command to run the Task class in the
**zoo.animal.feeding** package. In the following example, the package name and module
name are the same. It is common for the module name to match either the full package name
or the beginning of it.

```
java --module-path feeding
    --module zoo.animal.feeding/zoo.animal.feeding.Task
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Since you already saw that --module-path uses the short form of -p, we bet you won’t
be surprised to learn there is a short form of --module as well. The short option is -m. That
means the following command is equivalent:

```
java -p feeding
    -m zoo.animal.feeding/zoo.animal.feeding.Task
```

&emsp;&emsp;
In these examples, we used **feeding** as the module path because that’s where we 
compiled the code. This will change once we package the module and run that. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Table 12.2 lists the options you need to know for the java command.

> **Table 12.2** Options you need to know for using modules with **java**
> 
> |Use for|Abbreviation|Long form|
> |-------|------------|---------|
> |Module name |-m <name> |--module <name>|
> |Module path |-p <path> |--module-path <path>|


## IV. Packaging Our First Module
A module isn’t much use if we can run it only in the folder it was created in. Our next step is
to package it. Be sure to create a mods directory before running this command.

```
jar -cvf mods/zoo.animal.feeding.jar -C feeding/ .
```

&emsp;&emsp;
There’s nothing module-specific here. We are packaging everything under the feeding
directory and storing it in a JAR file named **zoo.animal.feeding.jar** under the mods
folder. This represents how the module JAR will look to other code that wants to use it. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Now let’s run the program again, but this time using the mods directory instead of the
loose classes:

```
java -p mods
    -m zoo.animal.feeding/zoo.animal.feeding.Task
```

&emsp;&emsp;
You might notice that this command looks identical to the one in the previous section
except for the directory. In the previous example, it was feeding. In this one, it is the
module path of mods. Since the module path is used, a module JAR is being run.
