# Diving into the Module Declaration

Now that we’ve successfully created modules, we can learn more about the module declaration. 
In these sections, we look at **exports**, **requires**, and **opens**. In the following section
on services, we explore **provides** and **uses**. Now would be a good time to mention that
these directives can appear in any order in the module declaration.

## I. Exporting a Package

We’ve already seen how **exports** _packageName_ exports a package to other modules. It’s
also possible to export a package to a specific module. Suppose the zoo decides that only
staff members should have access to the talks. We could update the module declaration
as follows:

```java
module zoo.animal.talks {
    exports zoo.animal.talks.content to zoo.staff;
    exports zoo.animal.talks.media;
    exports zoo.animal.talks.schedule;
    
    requires zoo.animal.feeding;
    requires zoo.animal.care;
}
```

From the **zoo.staff** module, nothing has changed. However, no other modules would
be allowed to access that package. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
You might have noticed that none of our other modules requires **zoo.animal.talks**
in the first place. However, we don’t know what other modules will exist in the future. It
is important to consider future use when designing modules. Since we want only the one
module to have access, we only allow access for that module.

> #### Exported Types
> We’ve been talking about exporting a package. But what does that mean, exactly? All
**public** classes, interfaces, enums, and records are exported. Further, any **public** and
**protected** fields and methods in those files are visible. <br/></br>
> Fields and methods that are **private** are not visible because they are not accessible
outside the class. Similarly, package fields and methods are not visible because they are not
accessible outside the package.

&emsp;&emsp;
The exports directive essentially gives us more levels of access control. Table 12.3 lists the
full access control options.

> **Table 12.3** Access control with modules
> 
> |Level|Within module code|Outside module|
> |---|---|---|
> |private |Available only within class |No access|
> |Package |Available only within package |No access|
> |protected |Available only within package or to subclasses |Accessible to subclasses only if package is exported|
> |public |Available to all classes |Accessible only if package is exported|

## II. Requiring a Module Transitively
As you saw earlier in this chapter, requires _moduleName_ specifies that the current module
depends on **moduleName**. There’s also a **requires transitive** _moduleName_, which
means that any module that **requires** this module will also depend on **moduleName**. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Well, that was a mouthful. Let’s look at an example. Figure 12.12 shows the modules
with dashed lines for the redundant relationships and solid lines for relationships specified in
the module-info. This shows how the module relationships would look if we were to only
use transitive dependencies.

> **Figure 12.12** Transitive dependency version of our modules

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter12/unit4/figure12.12.png" alt="Figure 12.12" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
For example, **zoo.animal.talks** depends on **zoo.animal.care**, which depends
on **zoo.animal.feeding**. That means the arrow between **zoo.animal.talks** and
**zoo.animal.feeding** no longer appears in Figure 12.12. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Now let’s look at the four module declarations. The first module remains unchanged. We
are exporting one package to any packages that use the module.

```java
module zoo.animal.feeding {
    exports zoo.animal.feeding;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The **zoo.animal.care** module is the first opportunity to improve things. Rather than
forcing all remaining modules to explicitly specify **zoo.animal.feeding**, the code uses
requires transitive.

```java
module zoo.animal.care {
    exports zoo.animal.care.medical;
    requires transitive zoo.animal.feeding;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
In the **zoo.animal.talks** module, we make a similar change and don’t force other
modules to specify **zoo.animal.care**. We also no longer need to specify
**zoo.animal.feeding**, so that line is commented out.

```java
module zoo.animal.talks {
    exports zoo.animal.talks.content to zoo.staff;
    exports zoo.animal.talks.media;
    exports zoo.animal.talks.schedule;
    // no longer needed requires zoo.animal.feeding;
    // no longer needed requires zoo.animal.care;
    requires transitive zoo.animal.care;
}
```

&emsp:&emsp:
Finally, in the zoo.staff module, we can get rid of two requires statements.

```java
module zoo.staff {
    // no longer needed requires zoo.animal.feeding;
    // no longer needed requires zoo.animal.care;
    requires zoo.animal.talks;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The more modules you have, the greater the benefits of the **requires transitive**
compound. It is also more convenient for the caller. If you were trying to work with this
zoo, you could just require **zoo.staff** and have the remaining dependencies 
automatically inferred.

### &emsp;&emsp; 1. Effects of requires transitive

Given our new module declarations, and using Figure 12.12, what is the effect of applying
the transitive modifier to the **requires** statement in our **zoo.animal.care module**?
Applying the transitive modifiers has the following effects:
- Module **zoo.animal.talks** can optionally declare that it requires the
  **zoo.animal.feeding** module, but it is not required.
- Module **zoo.animal.care** cannot be compiled or executed without access to the
  **zoo.animal.feeding** module.
- Module **zoo.animal.talks** cannot be compiled or executed without access to the
  **zoo.animal.feeding** module.

&emsp;&emsp;
These rules hold even if the **zoo.animal.care** and **zoo.animal.talks** modules do not
explicitly reference any packages in the **zoo.animal.feeding** module. On the other hand,
without the transitive modifier in our module declaration of **zoo.animal.care**, the
other modules would have to explicitly use requires in order to reference any packages in
the **zoo.animal.feeding** module.

### &emsp;&emsp; 2. Duplicate _requires_ Statements
One place the exam might try to trick you is mixing **requires** and **requires
transitive**. Can you think of a reason this code doesn’t compile?

```java
module bad.module {
    requires zoo.animal.talks;
    requires transitive zoo.animal.talks;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Java doesn’t allow you to repeat the same module in a **requires** clause. It is 
redundant and most likely an error in coding. Keep in mind that **requires transitive** is like
**requires** plus some extra behavior.

## III. Opening a Package
Java allows callers to inspect and call code at runtime with a technique called _reflection_. This
is a powerful approach that allows calling code that might not be available at compile time.
It can even be used to subvert access control! Don’t worry—you don’t need to know how to
write code using reflection for the exam. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The **opens** directive is used to enable reflection of a package within a module. You
only need to be aware that the **opens** directive exists rather than understanding it in detail
for the exam. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Since reflection can be dangerous, the module system requires developers to explicitly
allow reflection in the module declaration if they want calling modules to be allowed to
use it. The following shows how to enable reflection for two packages in the
**zoo.animal.talks** module:

```java
module zoo.animal.talks {
    opens zoo.animal.talks.schedule;
    opens zoo.animal.talks.media to zoo.staff;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first example allows any module using this one to use reflection. The second example
only gives that privilege to the **zoo.staff** module. There are two more directives you need
to know for the exam — **provides** and **uses** — which are covered in the following section.

> ### Real World Scenario
> #### Opening an Entire Module
> In the previous example, we opened two packages in the **zoo.animal.talks** module, but
suppose we instead wanted to open all packages for reflection. No problem. We can use the
open module modifier, rather than the opens directive (notice the s difference):
> ```java
>   open module zoo.animal.talks {
>   }
> ```
> With this module modifier, Java knows we want all the packages in the module to be open.
What happens if you apply both together?
> ```java
>   open module zoo.animal.talks {
>       opens zoo.animal.talks.schedule; // DOES NOT COMPILE
>   }
> ```
>  This does not compile because a modifier that uses the open modifier is not permitted to
use the opens directive. After all, the packages are already open!
