# Migrating an Application

Many applications were not designed to use the Java Platform Module System because they
were written before it was created or chose not to use it. Ideally, they were at least designed
with projects instead of as a big ball of mud. This section gives you an overview of strategies
for migrating an existing application to use modules. We cover ordering modules, bottom-up
migration, top-down migration, and how to split up an existing project.

> ### Real World Scenario
> #### Migrating Your Applications at Work
> The exam exists in a pretend universe where there are no open source dependencies and
applications are very small. These scenarios make learning and discussing migration far
easier. In the real world, applications have libraries that haven’t been updated in 10 or more
years, complex dependency graphs, and all sorts of surprises.
> 
> Note that you can use all the features of Java 17 without converting your application to
modules (except the features in this module chapter, of course!). Please make sure you
have a reason for migration and don’t think it is required.
> 
> This chapter does a great job teaching you what you need to know for the exam. However,
it does not adequately prepare you to convert real applications to use modules. If you find
yourself in that situation, consider reading _The Java Module System_ by Nicolai Parlog
(Manning Publications, 2019).

## I. Determining the Order
Before we can migrate our application to use modules, we need to know how the packages
and libraries in the existing application are structured. Suppose we have a simple 
application with three JAR files, as shown in Figure 12.14. The dependencies between projects
form a graph. Both of the representations in Figure 12.14 are equivalent. The arrows show
the dependencies by pointing from the project that will require the dependency to the one
that makes it available. In the language of modules, the arrow will go from **requires**
to **exports**.

&emsp;&emsp;
The right side of the diagram makes it easier to identify the top and bottom that top-down 
and bottom-up migration refer to. Projects that do not have any dependencies are at
the bottom. Projects that do have dependencies are at the top. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
In this example, there is only one order from top to bottom that honors all the dependencies. 
Figure 12.15 shows that the order is not always unique. Since two of the projects do
not have an arrow between them, either order is allowed when deciding migration order.

## II. Exploring a Bottom-Up Migration Strategy
The easiest approach to migration is a bottom-up migration. This approach works best when
you have the power to convert any JAR files that aren’t already modules. For a bottom-up
migration, you follow these steps:
1. Pick the lowest-level project that has not yet been migrated. (Remember the way we
   ordered them by dependencies in the previous section?)
2. Add a module-info.java file to that project. Be sure to add any exports to expose
   any package used by higher-level JAR files. Also, add a requires directive for any
   modules this module depends on.
3. Move this newly migrated named module from the classpath to the module path.
4. Ensure that any projects that have not yet been migrated stay as unnamed modules on
   the classpath.
5. Repeat with the next-lowest-level project until you are done.

&emsp;&emsp;
You can see this procedure applied to migrate three projects in Figure 12.16. Notice that
each project is converted to a module in turn. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
With a bottom-up migration, you are getting the lower-level projects in good shape. This
makes it easier to migrate the top-level projects at the end. It also encourages care in what
is exposed. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
During migration, you have a mix of named modules and unnamed modules. The named
modules are the lower-level ones that have been migrated. They are on the module path and
not allowed to access any unnamed modules.

> **Figure 12.16** Bottom-up migration

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter12/unit8/figure12.16.png" alt="Figure 12.16" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
The unnamed modules are on the classpath. They can access JAR files on both the classpath and the module path.

## III. Exploring a Top-Down Migration Strategy
A top-down migration strategy is most useful when you don’t have control of every JAR file
used by your application. For example, suppose another team owns one project. They are
just too busy to migrate. You wouldn’t want this situation to hold up your entire migration. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
For a top-down migration, you follow these steps:
1. Place all projects on the module path.
2. Pick the highest-level project that has not yet been migrated.
3. Add a module-info.java file to that project to convert the automatic module into a
   named module. Again, remember to add any exports or requires directives. You can
   use the automatic module name of other modules when writing the requires directive
   since most of the projects on the module path do not have names yet.
4. Repeat with the next-highest-level project until you are done.

&emsp;&emsp;
You can see this procedure applied in order to migrate three projects in Figure 12.17.
Notice that each project is converted to a module in turn.

> **Figure 12.17** Top-down migration

&emsp;&emsp;
With a top-down migration, you are conceding that all of the lower-level dependencies
are not ready but that you want to make the application itself a module. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
During migration, you have a mix of named modules and automatic modules. The named
modules are the higher-level ones that have been migrated. They are on the module path and
have access to the automatic modules. The automatic modules are also on the module path. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Table 12.18 reviews what you need to know about the two main migration strategies.
Make sure you know it well.

> **Table 12.18** Comparing migration strategies
> 
> |Category|Bottom-up|Top-down|
> |---|---|---|
> |Project that depends on all others |Unnamed module on classpath |Named module on module path|
> |Project that has no dependencies |Named module on module path |Automatic module on module path|

## IV. Splitting a Big Project into Modules
For the exam, you need to understand the basic process of splitting a big project into 
modules. You won’t be given a big project, of course. After all, there is only so much space to ask
a question. Luckily, the process is the same for a small project. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Suppose you start with an application that has a number of packages. The first step is to
break them into logical groupings and draw the dependencies between them. Figure 12.18
shows an imaginary system’s decomposition. Notice that there are seven packages on both
the left and right sides. There are fewer modules because some packages share a module.

> **Figure 12.18** First attempt at decomposition

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter12/unit8/figure12.18.png" alt="Figure 12.18" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
There’s a problem with this decomposition. Do you see it? The Java Platform
Module System does not allow for _cyclic dependencies_. A cyclic dependency, or _circular
dependency_, is when two things directly or indirectly depend on each other. If the
**zoo.tickets.delivery** module requires the **zoo.tickets.discount** module,
**zoo.tickets.discount** is not allowed to require the **zoo.tickets.delivery** module. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Now that we know that the decomposition in Figure 12.18 won’t work, what can we do
about it? A common technique is to introduce another module. That module contains the
code that the other two modules share. Figure 12.19 shows the new modules without any
cyclic dependencies. Notice the new module **zoo.tickets.etech**. We created new 
packages to put in that module. This allows the developers to put the common code in there and
break the dependency. No more cyclic dependencies!

> **Figure 12.19** Removing the cyclic dependencies

## V. Failing to Compile with a Cyclic Dependency
It is extremely important to understand that Java will not allow you to compile modules
that have circular dependencies. In this section, we look at an example leading to that 
compiler error. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Consider the zoo.butterfly module described here:

```java
// Butterfly.java
package zoo.butterfly;
public class Butterfly {
    private Caterpillar caterpillar;
}

// module-info.java
module zoo.butterfly {
    exports zoo.butterfly;
    requires zoo.caterpillar;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
We can’t compile this yet as we need to build **zoo.caterpillar** first. After all, our
butterfly requires it. Now we look at **zoo.caterpillar**:

```java
// Caterpillar.java
package zoo.caterpillar;
public class Caterpillar {
    Butterfly emergeCocoon() {
        // logic omitted
    }
}

// module-info.java
module zoo.caterpillar {
    exports zoo.caterpillar;
    requires zoo.butterfly;
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
We can’t compile this yet as we need to build **zoo.butterfly** first. Uh oh! Now
we have a stalemate. Neither module can be compiled. This is our circular dependency
problem at work. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
This is one of the advantages of the module system. It prevents you from writing code
that has a cyclic dependency. Such code won’t even compile! <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
You might be wondering what happens if three modules are involved. Suppose module
**ballA** requires module **ballB** and **ballB** requires module **ballC**. Can module **ballC**
require module **ballA**? No. This would create a cyclic dependency. Don’t believe us? Try
drawing it. You can follow your pencil around the circle from **ballA** to **ballB** to **ballC**
to **ballA** to . . . well, you get the idea. There are just too many balls in the air!

> #### Tip
> Java will still allow you to have a cyclic dependency between packages
within a module. It enforces that you do not have a cyclic dependency
between modules.
