# Introducing Modules

When writing code for the exam, you generally see small classes. After all, exam questions
have to fit on a single screen! When you work on real programs, they are much bigger. A
real project will consist of hundreds or thousands of classes grouped into packages. These
packages are grouped into Java archive (JAR) files. A JAR is a ZIP file with some extra
information, and the extension is .jar. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
In addition to code written by your team, most applications also use code written by
others. _Open source_ is software with the code supplied and is often free to use. Java has a
vibrant open source software (OSS) community, and those libraries are also supplied as JAR
files. For example, there are libraries to read files, connect to a database, and much more. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Some open source projects even depend on functionality in other open source projects.
For example, Spring is a commonly used framework, and JUnit is a commonly used testing
library. To use either, you need to make sure you have compatible versions of all the 
relevant JARs available at runtime. This complex chain of dependencies and minimum versions
is often referred to by the community as JAR _hell_. Hell is an excellent way of describing the
wrong version of a class being loaded or even a **ClassNotFoundException** at runtime. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The _Java Platform Module System_ (JPMS) groups code at a higher level. The main
purpose of a module is to provide groups of related packages that offer developers a
particular set of functionality. It’s like a JAR file, except a developer chooses which packages
are accessible outside the module. Let’s look at what modules are and what problems they
are designed to solve. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The Java Platform Module System includes the following:
- A format for module JAR files
- Partitioning of the JDK into modules
- Additional command-line options for Java tools

# I. Exploring a Module
In Chapter 1, “Building Blocks,” we had a small **Zoo** application. It had only one class and
just printed out one thing. Now imagine that we had a whole staff of programmers and were
automating the operations of the zoo. Many things need to be coded, including the 
interactions with the animals, visitors, the public website, and outreach. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
A _module_ is a group of one or more packages plus a special file called
**module-info.java**. The contents of this file are the _module declaration_. Figure 12.1 lists
just a few of the modules a zoo might need. We decided to focus on the animal interactions
in our example. The full zoo could easily have a dozen modules. In Figure 12.1, notice that
there are arrows between many of the modules. These represent _dependencies_, where one
module relies on code in another. The staff needs to feed the animals to keep their jobs.
The line from **zoo.staff** to **zoo.animal.feeding** shows that the former depends on
the latter.

&emsp;&emsp;
Now let’s drill down into one of these modules. Figure 12.2 shows what is inside the
**zoo.animal.talks** module. There are three packages with two classes each. (It’s a small
zoo.) There is also a strange file called **module-info.java**. This file is required to be inside
all modules. We explain this in more detail later in the chapter.

## II. Benefits of Modules
Modules look like another layer of things you need to know in order to program.
While using modules is optional, it is important to understand the problems they are
designed to solve:
- **Better access control**: In addition to the levels of access control covered in Chapter 5,
“Methods,” you can have packages that are only accessible to other packages in
the module.
- **Clearer dependency management**: Since modules specify what they rely on, Java can
complain about a missing JAR when starting up the program rather than when it is first
accessed at runtime.
- **Custom Java builds**: You can create a Java runtime that has only the parts of the JDK
that your program needs rather than the full one at over 150 MB.
- **Improved security**: Since you can omit parts of the JDK from your custom build, you
don’t have to worry about vulnerabilities discovered in a part you don’t use.
- **Improved performance**: Another benefit of a smaller Java package is improved startup
time and a lower memory requirement.
- **Unique package enforcement**: Since modules specify exposed packages, Java can ensure
that each package comes from only one module and avoid confusion about what is
being run.
