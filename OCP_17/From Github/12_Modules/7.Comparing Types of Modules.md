# Comparing Types of Modules

All the modules we’ve used so far in this chapter are called named modules. There are
two other types of modules: automatic modules and unnamed modules. In this section, 
we describe these three types of modules. On the exam, you will need to be able to
compare them.

## I. Named Modules
A _named module_ is one containing a _module-info.java_ file. To review, this file appears in
the root of the JAR alongside one or more packages. Unless otherwise specified, a module
is a named module. Named modules appear on the module path rather than the classpath.
Later, you learn what happens if a JAR containing a **module-info.java** file is on the
classpath. For now, just know it is not considered a named module because it is not on the
module path. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
As a way of remembering this, a named module has the name inside the
**module-info.java** file and is on the module path.

> #### Note
> Remember from Chapter 7, “Beyond Classes,” that the only way for sub-classes 
of sealed classes to be in a different package is to be within the
same-named module.

## II. Automatic Modules
An automatic module appears on the module path but does not contain a
**module-info.java** file. It is simply a regular JAR file that is placed on the module path
and gets treated as a module. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
As a way of remembering this, Java _automatically_ determines the module name. The code
referencing an automatic module treats it as if there is a **module-info.java** file present. It
automatically exports all packages. It also determines the module name. How does it determine 
the module name, you ask? Excellent question. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
To answer this, we need to provide a bit of history on JAR files and module adoption.
Every JAR file contains a special folder called **META-INF** and, within it, a text file called
**MANIFEST.MF**. It can be created automatically when the JAR is created or by hand by the
JAR’s author. Getting back to modules, many Java libraries weren’t quite ready to 
modularize when the feature was introduced. The authors were encouraged to declare the name they
intended to use for the module by adding a property named **Automatic-Module-Name** into
their **MANIFEST.MF** file.

> #### About the _MANIFEST.MF_ File
> A JAR file contains a special text file called **META-INF/MANIFEST.MF** that contains
information about the JAR. It’s been around significantly longer than modules—since the
early days of Java and JARs, to be exact. The figure shows how the manifest fits into the
directory structure of a JAR file.

> 
> The manifest contains extra information about the JAR file. For example, it often contains
the version of Java used to build the JAR file. For command-line programs, the class with
the `main()` method is commonly specified.
> 
> Each line in the manifest is a key/value pair separated by a colon. You can think of the
manifest as a map of property names and values. The default manifest in Java 17 looks
like this:
> ```
>   Manifest-Version: 1.0
>   Created-By: 17 (Oracle Corporation)
> ```

&emsp;&emsp;
Specifying a single property in the manifest allowed library providers to make things
easier for applications that wanted to use their library in a modular application. You can
think of it as a promise that when the library becomes a named module, it will use the 
specified module name. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
If the JAR file does not specify an automatic module name, Java will still allow you to use
it in the module path. In this case, Java will determine the module name for you. We’d say
that this happens automatically, but the joke is probably wearing thin by now. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Java determines the automatic module name by basing it on the filename of the JAR
file. Let’s go over the rules by starting with an example. Suppose we have a JAR file named
**holiday-calendar-1.0.0.jar**. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
First Java will remove the extension **.jar** from the name. Then Java will remove the version 
from the end of the JAR filename. This is important because we want module names to
be consistent. Having a different automatic module name every time you upgraded to a new
version would not be good! After all, this would force you to change the module declaration
of your nice, clean, modularized application every time you pulled in a later version of the
holiday calendar JAR. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Removing the version and extension gives us **holiday-calendar**. This leaves us with
a problem. Dashes (-) are not allowed in module names. Java solves this problem by
converting any special characters in the name to dots (.). As a result, the module name
is **holiday.calendar**. Any characters other than letters and numbers are considered
special characters in this replacement. Finally, any adjacent dots or leading/trailing dots
are removed. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Since that’s a number of rules, let’s review the algorithm in a list for determining the name
of an automatic module:
- If the **MANIFEST.MF** specifies an **Automatic-Module-Name**, use that. Otherwise, proceed 
with the remaining rules.
- Remove the file extension from the JAR name.
- Remove any version information from the end of the name. A version is digits and dots
with possible extra information at the end: for example, **-1.0.0** or **-1.0-RC**.
- Replace any remaining characters other than letters and numbers with dots.
- Replace any sequences of dots with a single dot.
- Remove the dot if it is the first or last character of the result.
Table 12.16 shows how to apply these rules to two examples where there is no automatic
module name specified in the manifest.

> **Table 12.16** Practicing with automatic module names
> 
> |#|Description|Example 1|Example 2|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |1 |Beginning JAR name |commons2-x-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar |mod_$-1.0.jar|
> |2 |Remove file extension |commons2-x-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT |mod_$-1.0|
> |3 |Remove version information |commons2-x |mod_$|
> |4 |Replace special characters |commons2.x |mod..|
> |5 |Replace sequence of dots |commons2.x |mod.|
> |6 |Remove leading/trailing dots (results in the automatic module name) |commons2.x |mod|

&emsp;&emsp;
While the algorithm for creating automatic module names does its best, it can’t always
come up with a good name. For example, **1.2.0-calendar-1.2.2-good-1.jar** isn’t conducive. 
Luckily, such names are rare and out of scope for the exam.

## III. Unnamed Modules
An _unnamed module_ appears on the classpath. Like an automatic module, it is a regular
JAR. Unlike an automatic module, it is on the classpath rather than the module path. This
means an unnamed module is treated like old code and a second-class citizen to modules. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
An unnamed module does not usually contain a **module-info.java** file. If it happens to
contain one, that file will be ignored since it is on the classpath. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Unnamed modules do not export any packages to named or automatic modules. The
unnamed module can read from any JARs on the classpath or module path. You can think of
an unnamed module as code that works the way Java worked before modules. Yes, we know
it is confusing for something that isn’t really a module to have the word _module_ in its name.

## IV. Reviewing Module Types
You can expect to get questions on the exam comparing the three types of modules. Please
study Table 12.17 thoroughly and be prepared to answer questions about these items in any
combination. A key point to remember is that code on the classpath can access the module
path. By contrast, code on the module path is unable to read from the classpath.

> **Table 12.17** Properties of module types
> 
> |Property|Named|Automatic|Unnamed|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Does a ______ module contain a **module-info.java** file? |Yes |No |Ignored if present|
> |Which packages does a ______ module export to other modules?|Those in **module-info.java** file |All packages |No packages|
> |Is a ______ module readable by other modules on the module path? |Yes |Yes |No|
> |Is a ______ module readable by other JARs on the classpath? |Yes |Yes |Yes|
