# Referencing Files and Directories

We begin this chapter by reviewing what files and directories are within a file system. We
also present the File class and Path interface along with how to create them.

## I. Conceptualizing the File System
We start with the basics. Data is stored on persistent storage devices, such as hard disk drives
and memory cards. A _file_ within the storage device holds data. Files are organized into hierarchies 
using directories. A _directory_ is a location that can contain files as well as other directories. 
When working with directories in Java, we often treat them like files. In fact, we use
many of the same classes and interfaces to operate on files and directories. For example, a
file and directory both can be renamed with the same Java method. Note that we often say
_file_ to mean _file_ or _directory_ in this chapter. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
To interact with files, we need to connect to the file system. The _file system_ is in charge
of reading and writing data within a computer. Different operating systems use different
file systems to manage their data. For example, Windows-based systems use a different file
system than Unix-based ones. For the exam, you just need to know how to issue commands
using the Java APIs. The JVM will automatically connect to the local file system, allowing
you to perform the same operations across multiple platforms. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Next, the _root directory_ is the topmost directory in the file system, from which all files
and directories inherit. In Windows, it is denoted with a drive letter such as **C:\**, while on
Linux, it is denoted with a single forward slash, **/**. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
A _path_ is a representation of a file or directory within a file system. Each file system
defines its own path separator character that is used between directory entries. The value to
the left of a separator is the parent of the value to the right of the separator. For example, the
path value **/user/home/zoo.txt** means that the file **zoo.txt** is inside the **home** directory,
with the **home** directory inside the **user** directory.

> #### Operating System File Separators
> Different operating systems vary in their format of pathnames. For example, Unix-based
systems use the forward slash, **/**, for paths, whereas Windows-based systems use the 
backslash, **\**, character. That said, many programming languages and file systems support both
types of slashes when writing path statements. Java offers a system property to retrieve the
local separator character for the current environment:
> ```
>      System.out.print(System.getProperty("file.separator"));
> ```

&emsp;&emsp;
We show how a directory and file system is organized in a hierarchical manner in
Figure 14.1.

&emsp;&emsp;
This diagram shows the root directory, **c:**, as containing two directories, **app** and **zoo**,
along with the file **info.txt**. Within the app directory, there are two more folders,
**animals** and **employees**, along with the file **java.exe**. Finally, the **animals** directory
contains two files, **Bear.java** and **Bear.class**. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We use both absolute and relative paths to the file or directory within the file system.
The _absolute path_ of a file or directory is the full path from the root directory to the file
or directory, including all subdirectories that contain the file or directory. Alternatively, the
_relative path_ of a file or directory is the path from the current working directory to the file or
directory. For example, the following is an absolute path to the **Bear.java** file:

```
C:\app\animals\Bear.java
```

The following is a relative path to the same file, assuming the user’s current directory is
set to **C:\app**: <br />

```
animals\Bear.java
```

Determining whether a path is relative or absolute is file-system dependent. To match the
exam, we adopt the following conventions:
- If a path starts with a forward slash (/), it is absolute, with / as the root directory, such
  as **/bird/parrot.png**.
- If a path starts with a drive letter (c:), it is absolute, with the drive letter as the root
  directory, such as **C:/bird/info**.
- Otherwise, it is a relative path, such as **bird/parrot.png**.

&emsp;&emsp;
Absolute and relative paths can contain path symbols. A _path symbol_ is one of a reserved
series of characters with special meaning in some file systems. For the exam, there are two
path symbols you need to know, as listed in Table 14.1.

> **Table 14.1** File-system symbols
> 
> | Symbol | Description |
> |---|---|
> |. |A reference to the current directory
> |.. |A reference to the parent of the current directory

&emsp;&emsp;
Looking at Figure 14.2, suppose the current directory is **/fish/shark/hammerhead**.
In this case, **../swim.txt** is a valid relative path equivalent to **/fish/shark/swim.txt**.
Likewise, **./play.png** refers to **play.png** in the current directory. These symbols can also
be combined for greater effect. For example, **../../clownfish** is a relative path equivalent
to **/fish/clownfish** within the file system. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Sometimes you’ll see path symbols that are redundant or unnecessary. For example,
the absolute path **/fish/clownfish/../shark/./swim.txt** can be simplified to
**/fish/shark/swim.txt**. We see how to handle these redundancies later in the chapter
when we cover `normalize()`.

> **Figure 14.2** Relative paths using path symbols

&emsp;&emsp;
A _symbolic link_ is a special file within a file system that serves as a reference or pointer
to another file or directory. Suppose we have a symbolic link from **/zoo/user/favorite** to
**/fish/shark**. The **shark** folder and its elements can be accessed directly or via the
symbolic link. For example, the following paths reference the same file:

```
/fish/shark/swim.txt
/zoo/user/favorite/swim.txt
```

&emsp;&emsp;
In general, symbolic links are transparent to the user, as the operating system takes care
of resolving the reference to the actual file. While the I/O APIs do not support symbolic links,
NIO.2 includes full support for creating, detecting, and navigating symbolic links within the
file system.

## II. Creating a _File_ or _Path_
In order to do anything useful, you first need an object that represents the path to a
particular file or directory on the file system. Using legacy I/O, this is the **java.io.File**
class, whereas with NIO.2, it is the **java.nio.file.Path** interface. The **File** class and
**Path** interface cannot read or write data within a file, although they are passed as a 
reference to other classes, as you see in this chapter.

> #### Tip
> Remember, a **File** or **Path** can represent a file or a directory.

### &emsp;&emsp; A. Creating a _File_
The **File** class is created by calling its constructor. This code shows three different
constructors:

```java
File zooFile1 = new File("/home/tiger/data/stripes.txt");
File zooFile2 = new File("/home/tiger", "data/stripes.txt");

File parent = new File("/home/tiger");
File zooFile3 = new File(parent, "data/stripes.txt");

System.out.println(zooFile1.exists());
```

&emsp;&emsp;
All three create a **File** object that points to the same location on disk. If we passed **null**
as the parent to the final constructor, it would be ignored, and the method would behave
the same way as the single **String** constructor. For fun, we also show how to tell if the file
exists on the file system.

### &emsp;&emsp; B. Creating a _Path_
Since **Path** is an interface, we can’t create an instance directly. After all, interfaces don’t have
constructors! Java provides a number of classes and methods that you can use to obtain
**Path** objects. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The simplest and most straightforward way to obtain a **Path** object is to use a **static**
factory method defined on **Path** or **Paths**. All four of these examples point to the same reference 
on disk:

```java
Path zooPath1 = Path.of("/home/tiger/data/stripes.txt");
Path zooPath2 = Path.of("/home", "tiger", "data", "stripes.txt");

Path zooPath3 = Paths.get("/home/tiger/data/stripes.txt");
Path zooPath4 = Paths.get("/home", "tiger", "data", "stripes.txt");

System.out.println(Files.exists(zooPath1));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Both methods allow passing a varargs parameter to pass additional path elements. The
values are combined and automatically separated by the operating system–dependent file
separator. We also show the Files helper class, which can check if the file exists on the
file system. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
As you can see, there are two ways of doing the same thing here. The `Path.of()` method
was introduced in Java 11 as a **static** method on the interface. The **Paths** factory class
also provides a `get()` method to do the same thing. Note the **s** at the end of the **Paths**
class to distinguish it from the **Path** interface. We use P`ath.of()` and `Paths.get()`
interchangeably in this chapter.

> #### Note
> You might notice that both the I/O and NIO.2 classes can interact with
a URI. A uniform resource identifier (URI) is a string of characters that
identifies a resource. It begins with a schema that indicates the resource
type, followed by a path value such as **file://** for local file systems and
**http://**, **https://**, and **ftp://** for remote file systems.

### &emsp;&emsp; C. Switching between _File_ and _Path_
Since **File** and **Path** both reference locations on disk, it is helpful to be able to convert
between them. Luckily, Java makes this easy by providing methods to do just that:

```java
File file = new File("rabbit");
Path nowPath = file.toPath();
File backToFile = nowPath.toFile();
```

Many older libraries use **File**, making it convenient to be able to get a **File** from a
**Path** and vice versa. When working with newer applications, you should rely on NIO.2’s
**Path** interface, as it contains a lot more features. For example, only NIO.2 provides
**FileSystem** support, as we are about to discuss.

### &emsp;&emsp; D. Obtaining a Path from the FileSystems Class
NIO.2 makes extensive use of creating objects with factory classes. The **FileSystems** class
creates instances of the abstract **FileSystem** class. The latter includes methods for working
with the file system directly. Both `Paths.get()` and `Path.of()` are shortcuts for this
**FileSystem** method. Let’s rewrite our earlier examples one more time to see how to obtain
a **Path** instance the long way:

```java
Path zooPath1 = FileSystems.getDefault()
    .getPath("/home/tiger/data/stripes.txt");
Path zooPath2 = FileSystems.getDefault()
    .getPath("/home", "tiger", "data", "stripes.txt");
```

### &emsp;&emsp; E. Reviewing I/O and NIO.2 Relationships
The model for I/O is smaller, and you only need to understand the File class. In contrast,
NIO.2 has more features and makes extensive use of the factory pattern. You should become
comfortable with this approach. Many of your interactions with NIO.2 will require two
types: an abstract class or interface and a factory or helper class. Figure 14.3 shows the 
relationships among the classes and interface we have used in this chapter so far.

> **Figure 14.3** I/O and NIO.2 class and interface relationships

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter14/figure14.3.png" alt="Figure 14.3" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
Review Figure 14.3 carefully. In particular, keep an eye on whether the class name is
singular or plural. Classes with plural names include methods to create or operate on
class/interface instances with singular names. Remember, as a convenience (and source of
confusion), a **Path** can also be created from the **Path** interface using the **static** factory
`of()` method.

> #### Note
> The **java.io.File** is the I/O class, while **Files** is an NIO.2 helper class.
**Files** operates on **Path** instances, not **java.io.File** instances. We
know this is confusing, but they are from completely different APIs!

&emsp;&emsp;
Table 14.2 reviews the APIs we have covered for creating **java.io.File** and
**java.nio.file.Path** objects. When reading the table, remember that static methods
operate on the class/interface, while instance methods require an instance of an object. Be
sure you know this well before proceeding with the rest of the chapter.
