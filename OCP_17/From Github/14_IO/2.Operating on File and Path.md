# Operating on _File_ and _Path_

Now that we know how to create **File** and **Path** objects, we can start using them to do
useful things. In this section, we explore the functionality available to us that involves
directories.

## I. Using Shared Functionality
Many operations can be done using both the I/O and NIO.2 libraries. We present many
common APIs in Table 14.3 and Table 14.4. Although these tables may seem like a lot of
methods to learn, many of them are self-explanatory. You can ignore the vararg parameters
for now. We explain those later in the chapter.

> **Table 14.3** Common **File** and **Path** operations
> 
> |Description|I/O file instance method|NIO.2 path instance method|
> |---|---|---|
> |Gets name of file/directory |getName() |getFileName()|
> |Retrieves parent directory or **null** if there is none |getParent() |getParent()|
> |Checks if file/directory is absolute path |isAbsolute() |isAbsolute()|

> **Table 14.4** Common **File** and **Files** operations
> 
> | Description                               |I/O file instance method|NIO.2 files static method|
> |-------------------------------------------|---|---|
> | Deletes file/directory                    |delete() |deleteIfExists(Path p) throws IOException|
> | Checks if file/directory exists           |exists() |exists(Path p, LinkOption... o)|
> | Retrieves absolute path of file/directory |getAbsolutePath() |toAbsolutePath()|
> | Checks if resource is directory           |isDirectory() |isDirectory(Path p, LinkOption... o)|
> | Checks if resource is file                |isFile() |isRegularFile(Path p, LinkOption... o)|
> |Returns the time the file was last modified |lastModified() |getLastModifiedTime(Path p, LinkOption... o) throws IOException
> |Retrieves number of bytes in file |length() |size(Path p) throws IOException
> |Lists contents of directory |listFiles() |list(Path p) throws IOException
> |Creates directory |mkdir() |createDirectory(Path p, FileAttribute... a) throws IOException
> |Creates directory including any nonexistent parent directories |mkdirs() |createDirectories(Path p, FileAttribute... a) throws IOException
> |Renames file/directory denoted |renameTo(File dest) |move(Path src, Path dest, CopyOption... o) throws IOException

&emsp;&emsp;
Now let’s try to use some of these APIs. The following is a sample program using only
legacy I/O APIs. Given a file path, it outputs information about the file or directory, such as
whether it exists, what files are contained within it, and so forth:

```
10: public static void io() {
11:     var file = new File("C:\\data\\zoo.txt");
12:     if (file.exists()) {
13:         System.out.println("Absolute Path: " + file.getAbsolutePath());
14:         System.out.println("Is Directory: " + file.isDirectory());
15:         System.out.println("Parent Path: " + file.getParent());
16:         if (file.isFile()) {
17:             System.out.println("Size: " + file.length());
18:             System.out.println("Last Modified: " + file.lastModified());
19:         } else {
20:             for (File subfile : file.listFiles()) {
21:             System.out.println(" " + subfile.getName());
22:         } } } }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
If the path provided points to a valid file, the program outputs something similar to the
following due to the **if** statement on line 16:

```
Absolute Path: C:\data\zoo.txt
Is Directory: false
Parent Path: C:\data
Size: 12382
Last Modified: 1650610000000
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Finally, if the path provided points to a valid directory, such as **C:\data**, the program
outputs something similar to the following, thanks to the else block:

```
Absolute Path: C:\data
Is Directory: true
Parent Path: C:\
    employees.txt
    zoo.txt
    zoo-backup.txt
```

&emsp;&emsp;
In these examples, you see that the output of an I/O-based program is completely
dependent on the directories and files available at runtime in the underlying file system. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
On the exam, you might see paths that look like files but are directories or vice versa. For
example, **/data/zoo.txt** could be a file or a directory, even though it has a file extension.
Don’t assume it is either unless the question tells you it is!

> #### Note
> In the previous example, we used two backslashes (\\) in the path
**String**, such as **C:\\data\\zoo.txt**. When the compiler sees a **\\** inside
a **String** expression, it interprets it as a single **\** value.

&emsp;&emsp;
Now, let’s write that same program using only NIO.2 and see how it differs:

```
25: public static void nio() throws IOException {
26: var path = Path.of("C:\\data\\zoo.txt");
27: if (Files.exists(path)) {
28:     System.out.println("Absolute Path: " + path.toAbsolutePath());
29:     System.out.println("Is Directory: " + Files.isDirectory(path));
30:     System.out.println("Parent Path: " + path.getParent());
31:     if (Files.isRegularFile(path)) {
32:         System.out.println("Size: " + Files.size(path));
33:         System.out.println("Last Modified: " 
34:             + Files.getLastModifiedTime(path));
35:     } else {
36:         try (Stream<Path> stream = Files.list(path)) {
37:             stream.forEach(p -> 
38:                 System.out.println(" " + p.getName()));
39:         } } } }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Most of this example is equivalent and replaces the I/O method calls in the previous tables 
with the NIO.2 versions. However, there are key differences. First, line 25 declares a
checked exception. More APIs in NIO.2 throw **IOException** than the I/O APIs did. In this
case, `Files.size()`, `Files.getLastModifiedTime()`, and `Files.list()` throw an
**IOException**. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Second, lines 36–39 use a **Stream** and a lambda instead of a loop. Since streams use lazy
evaluation, this means the method will load each path element as needed, rather than the
entire directory at once.

> #### Closing the Stream
> Did you notice that in the last code sample, we put our **Stream** object inside a try-with-resources? 
The NIO.2 stream-based methods open a connection to the file system that must
be properly closed; otherwise, a resource leak could ensue. A resource leak within the file
system means the path may be locked from modification long after the process that used it
is completed.
>
> If you assumed that a stream’s terminal operation would automatically close the underlying
file resources, you’d be wrong. There was a lot of debate about this behavior when it was
first presented; in short, requiring developers to close the stream won out.
> 
> On the plus side, not all streams need to be closed: only those that open resources, like the
ones found in NIO.2. For instance, you didn’t need to close any of the streams you worked
with in Chapter 10, “Streams.”
> 
> Finally, the exam doesn’t always properly close NIO.2 resources. To match the exam, we
sometimes skip closing NIO.2 resources in review and practice questions. Always use 
try-with-resources statements with these NIO.2 methods in your own code.

&emsp;&emsp;
For the remainder of this section, we only discuss the NIO.2 methods, because they are
more important. There is also more to know about them, and they are more likely to come
up on the exam.

## II. Handling Methods That Declare _IOException_
Many of the methods presented in this chapter declare **IOException**. Common causes of a
method throwing this exception include the following:

- Loss of communication to the underlying file system.
- File or directory exists but cannot be accessed or modified.
- File exists but cannot be overwritten.
- File or directory is required but does not exist.

&emsp;&emsp;
Methods that access or change files and directories, such as those in the **Files** class,
often declare **IOException**. There are exceptions to this rule, as we will see. For example,
the method `Files.exists()` does not declare **IOException**. If it did throw an exception
when the file did not exist, it would never be able to return **false**! As a rule of thumb,
if a NIO.2 method declares an **IOException**, it _usually_ requires the paths it operates
on to exist.

## III. Providing NIO.2 Optional Parameters
Many of the NIO.2 methods in this chapter include a varargs that takes an optional list of
values. Table 14.5 presents the arguments you should be familiar with for the exam.

> **Table 14.5** Common NIO.2 method arguments
> 
> | Enum type            | Interface inherited         |Enum value|Details|
> |----------------------|-----------------------------|---|---|
> | LinkOption           | CopyOption <br/> OpenOption |NOFOLLOW_LINKS |Do not follow symbolic links.
> | StandardCopyOption   | CopyOption                  |ATOMIC_MOVE |Move file as atomic file system operation.
> | //                   | //                          |COPY_ATTRIBUTES |Copy existing attributes to new file.
> | //                   | //                          |REPLACE_EXISTING |Overwrite file if it already exists.
> | StandardOpenOption   | OpenOption | APPEND | If file is already open for write, append to the end.
> |//|//|CREATE |Create new file if it does not exist.
> |//|//|CREATE_NEW |Create new file only if it does not exist; fail otherwise.
> |//|//|READ |Open for read access.
> |//|//|TRUNCATE_EXISTING |If file is already open for write, erase file and append to beginning.
> |//|//|WRITE |Open for write access.
> |FileVisitOption |N/A |FOLLOW_LINKS |Follow symbolic links.

&emsp;&emsp;
With the exceptions of `Files.copy()` and `Files.move()`, we won’t discuss these
varargs parameters each time we present a method. Their behavior should be straightforward, 
though. For example, can you figure out what the following call to `Files.exists()`
with the **LinkOption** does in the following code snippet?

```java
Path path = Paths.get("schedule.xml");
boolean exists = Files.exists(path, LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The `Files.exists()` simply checks whether a file exists. But if the parameter is a
symbolic link, the method checks whether the target of the symbolic link exists, instead.
Providing **LinkOption**. **NOFOLLOW_LINKS** means the default behavior will be overridden,
and the method will check whether the symbolic link itself exists. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Note that some of the enums in Table 14.5 inherit an interface. That means some
methods accept a variety of enum types. For example, the `Files.move()` method takes a
**CopyOption** vararg so it can take enums of different types, and more options can be added
over time.

```java
void copy(Path source, Path target) throws IOException {
    Files.move(source, target,
        LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS,
        StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE);
}
```

## IV. Interacting with NIO.2 Paths
Just like String values, Path instances are immutable. In the following example, the **Path**
operation on the second line is lost since p is immutable:

```java
Path p = Path.of("whale");
p.resolve("krill");
System.out.println(p); // whale
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Many of the methods available in the Path interface transform the path value in some
way and return a new **Path** object, allowing the methods to be chained. We demonstrate 
chaining in the following example, the details of which we discuss in this section of
the chapter:

```java
Path.of("/zoo/../home").getParent().normalize().toAbsolutePath();
```

### &emsp;&emsp; 1. Viewing the Path
The **Path** interface contains three methods to retrieve basic information about the path 
representation. The `toString()` method returns a **String** representation of the entire path.
In fact, it is the only method in the **Path** interface to return a **String**. Many of the other
methods in the **Path** interface return **Path** instances. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The `getNameCount()` and `getName()` methods are often used together to retrieve the
number of elements in the path and a reference to each element, respectively. These two
methods do not include the root directory as part of the path.

```java
Path path = Paths.get("/land/hippo/harry.happy");
System.out.println("The Path Name is: " + path);
for (int i = 0; i < path.getNameCount(); i++)
    System.out.println(" Element " + i + " is: " + path.getName(i));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Notice that we didn’t call `toString()` explicitly on the second line. Remember, Java calls
`toString()` on any **Object** as part of string concatenation. We use this feature throughout
the examples in this chapter. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The code prints the following:

```
The Path Name is: /land/hippo/harry.happy
    Element 0 is: land
    Element 1 is: hippo
    Element 2 is: harry.happy
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Even though this is an absolute path, the root element is not included in the list of names.
As we said, these methods do not consider the root part of the path.

```java
var p = Path.of("/");
System.out.print(p.getNameCount());     // 0
System.out.print(p.getName(0));         // IllegalArgumentException
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Notice that if you try to call `getName()` with an invalid index, it will throw an exception
at runtime.

> #### Note
> Our examples print / as the file separator character because of the
system we are using. Your actual output may vary throughout this
chapter.

### &emsp;&emsp; 2. Creating Part of the Path
The **Path** interface includes the `subpath()` method to select portions of a path. It takes two
parameters: an inclusive **beginIndex** and an exclusive **endIndex**. This should sound familiar as
it is how **String**’s `substring()` method works, as you saw in Chapter 4, “Core APIs.” <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The following code snippet shows how `subpath()` works. We also print the elements of the
**Path** using `getName()` so that you can see how the indices are used.

```java
var p = Paths.get("/mammal/omnivore/raccoon.image");
System.out.println("Path is: " + p);
for (int i = 0; i < p.getNameCount(); i++) {
    System.out.println(" Element " + i + " is: " + p.getName(i));
}
System.out.println();
System.out.println("subpath(0,3): " + p.subpath(0, 3));
System.out.println("subpath(1,2): " + p.subpath(1, 2));
System.out.println("subpath(1,3): " + p.subpath(1, 3));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The output of this code snippet is the following:

```
Path is: /mammal/omnivore/raccoon.image
    Element 0 is: mammal
    Element 1 is: omnivore
    Element 2 is: raccoon.image
 
subpath(0,3): mammal/omnivore/raccoon.image
subpath(1,2): omnivore
subpath(1,3): omnivore/raccoon.image
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Like `getNameCount()` and `getName()`, `subpath()` is zero-indexed and does not
include the root. Also like `getName()`, `subpath()` throws an exception if invalid indices
are provided.

```java
var q = p.subpath(0, 4); // IllegalArgumentException
var x = p.subpath(1, 1); // IllegalArgumentException
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first example throws an exception at runtime, since the maximum index value
allowed is 3. The second example throws an exception since the start and end indexes are
the same, leading to an empty path value.

### &emsp;&emsp; 3. Accessing Path Elements
The **Path** interface contains numerous methods for retrieving particular elements of a **Path**,
returned as **Path** objects themselves. The `getFileName()` method returns the **Path** element of
the current file or directory, while `getParent()` returns the full path of the containing directory.
The `getParent()` method returns **null** if operated on the root path or at the top of a relative
path. The `getRoot()` method returns the root element of the file within the file system, or null
if the path is a relative path. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Consider the following method, which prints various **Path** elements:

```java
public void printPathInformation(Path path) {
    System.out.println("Filename is: " + path.getFileName());
    System.out.println(" Root is: " + path.getRoot());
    Path currentParent = path;
    while ((currentParent = currentParent.getParent()) != null)
        System.out.println(" Current parent is: " + currentParent);
    System.out.println();
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The while loop in the printPathInformation() method continues until
getParent() returns null. We apply this method to the following three paths:

```java
printPathInformation(Path.of("zoo"));
printPathInformation(Path.of("/zoo/armadillo/shells.txt"));
printPathInformation(Path.of("./armadillo/../shells.txt"));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This sample application produces the following output:

```
Filename is: zoo
    Root is: null
 
Filename is: shells.txt
    Root is: /
    Current parent is: /zoo/armadillo
    Current parent is: /zoo
    Current parent is: /
 
Filename is: shells.txt
    Root is: null
    Current parent is: ./armadillo/..
    Current parent is: ./armadillo
    Current parent is: .
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Reviewing the sample output, you can see the difference in the behavior of `getRoot()` on
absolute and relative paths. As you can see in the first and last examples, the `getParent()`
method does not traverse relative paths outside the current working directory. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
You also see that these methods do not resolve the path symbols and treat them as a 
distinct part of the path. While most of the methods in this part of the chapter treat path 
symbols as part of the path, we present one shortly that cleans up path symbols.

### &emsp;&emsp; 4. Resolving Paths
Suppose you want to concatenate paths in a manner similar to how we concatenate strings.
The resolve() method provides overloaded versions that let you pass either a Path or String
parameter. The object on which the resolve() method is invoked becomes the basis of the new
Path object, with the input argument being appended onto the Path. Let’s see what happens if
we apply resolve() to an absolute path and a relative path:

```java
Path path1 = Path.of("/cats/../panther");
Path path2 = Path.of("food");
System.out.println(path1.resolve(path2));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The code snippet generates the following output:

```
/cats/../panther/food
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Like the other methods we’ve seen, resolve() does not clean up path symbols. In this
example, the input argument to the resolve() method was a relative path, but what if it
had been an absolute path?

```java
Path path3 = Path.of("/turkey/food");
System.out.println(path3.resolve("/tiger/cage"));
```

Since the input parameter is an absolute path, the output would be the following:
/tiger/cage
For the exam, you should be cognizant of mixing absolute and relative paths with the
`resolve()` method. If an absolute path is provided as input to the method, that is the value
returned. Simply put, you cannot combine two absolute paths using `resolve()`.

> #### Tip
> On the exam, when you see `resolve()`, think concatenation.

### &emsp;&emsp; 5. Relativizing a Path
The **Path** interface includes a relativize() method for constructing the relative path from
one Path to another, often using path symbols. What do you think the following examples
will print?

```java
var path1 = Path.of("fish.txt");
var path2 = Path.of("friendly/birds.txt");
System.out.println(path1.relativize(path2));
System.out.println(path2.relativize(path1));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The examples print the following:

```
../friendly/birds.txt
../../fish.txt
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The idea is this: if you are pointed at a path in the file system, what steps would
you need to take to reach the other path? For example, to get to **fish.txt** from
**friendly/birds.txt**, you need to go up two levels (the file itself counts as one level)
and then select **fish.txt**. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
If both path values are relative, the `relativize()` method computes the paths as if they
are in the same current working directory. Alternatively, if both path values are absolute, the
method computes the relative path from one absolute location to another, regardless of the
current working directory. The following example demonstrates this property when run on a
Windows computer:

```java
Path path3 = Paths.get("E:\\habitat");
Path path4 = Paths.get("E:\\sanctuary\\raven\\poe.txt");
System.out.println(path3.relativize(path4));
System.out.println(path4.relativize(path3));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This code snippet produces the following output:

```
..\sanctuary\raven\poe.txt
..\..\..\habitat
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The `relativize()` method requires both paths to be absolute or relative and throws an
exception if the types are mixed.

```java
Path path1 = Paths.get("/primate/chimpanzee");
Path path2 = Paths.get("bananas.txt");
path1.relativize(path2); // IllegalArgumentException
```

&emsp;&emsp;
On Windows-based systems, it also requires that if absolute paths are used, both paths
must have the same root directory or drive letter. For example, the following would also
throw an IllegalArgumentException on a Windows-based system: <br />

```java
Path path3 = Paths.get("C:\\primate\\chimpanzee");
Path path4 = Paths.get("D:\\storage\\bananas.txt");
path3.relativize(path4); // IllegalArgumentException
```

### &emsp;&emsp; 6. Normalizing a Path
So far, we’ve presented a number of examples that included path symbols that were 
unnecessary. Luckily, Java provides the `normalize()` method to eliminate unnecessary 
redundancies in a path. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Remember, the path symbol .. refers to the parent directory, while the path symbol . refers
to the current directory. We can apply `normalize()` to some of our previous paths.

```java
var p1 = Path.of("./armadillo/../shells.txt");
System.out.println(p1.normalize()); // shells.txt

var p2 = Path.of("/cats/../panther/food");
System.out.println(p2.normalize()); // /panther/food

var p3 = Path.of("../../fish.txt");
System.out.println(p3.normalize()); // ../../fish.txt
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first two examples apply the path symbols to remove the redundancies, but what
about the last one? That is as simplified as it can be. The `normalize()` method does not
remove all of the path symbols, only the ones that can be reduced. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The `normalize()` method also allows us to compare equivalent paths. Consider the following example:

```java
var p1 = Paths.get("/pony/../weather.txt");
var p2 = Paths.get("/weather.txt");
System.out.println(p1.equals(p2));                          // false
System.out.println(p1.normalize().equals(p2.normalize()));  // true
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The `equals()` method returns **true** if two paths represent the same value. In the first
comparison, the path values are different. In the second comparison, the path values have
both been reduced to the same normalized value, **/weather.txt**. This is the primary
function of the `normalize()` method: to allow us to better compare different paths.

### &emsp;&emsp; 7. Retrieving the Real File System Path
While working with theoretical paths is useful, sometimes you want to verify that the path
exists within the file system using `toRealPath()`. This method is similar to normalize() in that
it eliminates any redundant path symbols. It is also similar to `toAbsolutePath()`, in that it will
join the path with the current working directory if the path is relative. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Unlike those two methods, though, `toRealPath()` will throw an exception if the path does
not exist. In addition, it will follow symbolic links, with an optional **LinkOption** varargs
parameter to ignore them. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s say that we have a file system in which we have a symbolic link from **/zebra** to
**/horse**. What do you think the following will print, given a current working directory of
**/horse/schedule**?

```java
System.out.println(Paths.get("/zebra/food.txt").toRealPath());
System.out.println(Paths.get(".././food.txt").toRealPath());
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The output of both lines is the following:

```
/horse/food.txt
```

&emsp;&emsp;
In this example, the absolute and relative paths both resolve to the same absolute
file, as the symbolic link points to a real file within the file system. We can also use the
`toRealPath()` method to gain access to the current working directory as a **Path** object.

```java
System.out.println(Paths.get(".").toRealPath());
```

### &emsp;&emsp; 8. Reviewing NIO.2 Path APIs
We’ve covered a lot of instance methods on Path in this section. Table 14.6 lists them
for review.

> **Table 14.6** Path APIs
> 
> |Description|Method or constructor|
> |---|---|
> |File path as string |public String **toString**()
> |Single segment |public Path **getName**(int index)

## V. Creating, Moving, and Deleting Files and Directories

Since creating, moving, and deleting have some nuance, we flesh them out in this section.

### &emsp;&emsp; 1. Making Directories

To create a directory, we use these **Files** methods:

```java
public static Path createDirectory(Path dir,
    FileAttribute<?>... attrs) throws IOException  
    
public static Path createDirectories(Path dir,
    FileAttribute<?>... attrs) throws IOException
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The `createDirectory()` method will create a directory and throw an
exception if it already exists or if the paths leading up to the directory do not exist. The
`createDirectories()` method creates the target directory along with any nonexistent
parent directories leading up to the path. If all of the directories already exist,
`createDirectories()` will simply complete without doing anything. This is useful in 
situations where you want to ensure a directory exists and create it if it does not. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Both of these methods also accept an optional list of **FileAttribute<?>** values to apply
to the newly created directory or directories. We discuss file attributes toward the end of
the chapter. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The following shows how to create directories:

```java
Files.createDirectory(Path.of("/bison/field"));
Files.createDirectories(Path.of("/bison/field/pasture/green"));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first example creates a new directory, field, in the directory **/bison**, assuming
**/bison** exists; otherwise, an exception is thrown. Contrast this with the second example,
which creates the directory **green** along with any of the following parent directories if they
do not already exist, including **bison**, **field**, and **pasture**.

### &emsp;&emsp; 2. Copying Files
The **Files** class provides a method for copying files and directories within the file system.

```java
public static Path copy(Path source, Path target,
    CopyOption... options) throws IOException
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The method copies a file or directory from one location to another using **Path** objects.
The following shows an example of copying a file and a directory:

```java
Files.copy(Paths.get("/panda/bamboo.txt"),
    Paths.get("/panda-save/bamboo.txt"));

Files.copy(Paths.get("/turtle"), Paths.get("/turtleCopy"));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
When directories are copied, the copy is shallow. A _shallow copy_ means that the files and
subdirectories within the directory are not copied. A _deep copy_ means that the entire tree
is copied, including all of its content and subdirectories. A deep copy typically requires
_recursion_, where a method calls itself.

```java
public void copyPath(Path source, Path target) {
    try {
        Files.copy(source, target);
        if (Files.isDirectory(source))
            try (Stream<Path> s = Files.list(source)) {
                s.forEach(p -> copyPath(p,
                target.resolve(p.getFileName())));
            }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle exception
    }
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The method first copies the path, whether a file or a directory. If it is a directory, only a
shallow copy is performed. Next, it checks whether the path is a directory and, if it is, 
performs a recursive copy of each of its elements. What if the method comes across a symbolic
link? Don’t worry: the JVM will not follow symbolic links when using the `list()` method.

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a. Copying and Replacing Files
By default, if the target already exists, the `copy()` method will throw an exception.
You can change this behavior by providing the **StandardCopyOption** enum value
**REPLACE_EXISTING** to the method. The following method call will overwrite the
**movie.txt** file if it already exists:

```java
Files.copy(Paths.get("book.txt"), Paths.get("movie.txt"),
    StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
For the exam, you need to know that without the **REPLACE_EXISTING** option, this
method will throw an exception if the file already exists.

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; b. Copying Files with I/O Streams
The **Files** class includes two `copy()` methods that operate with I/O streams.

```java
public static long copy(InputStream in, Path target,
    CopyOption... options) throws IOException
    
public static long copy(Path source, OutputStream out)
    throws IOException
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first method reads the contents of an I/O stream and writes the output to a file. The
second method reads the contents of a file and writes the output to an I/O stream. These
methods are quite convenient if you need to quickly read/write data from/to disk. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The following are examples of each `copy()` method:

```java
try (var is = new FileInputStream("source-data.txt")) {
    // Write I/O stream data to a file
    Files.copy(is, Paths.get("/mammals/wolf.txt"));
}

Files.copy(Paths.get("/fish/clown.xsl"), System.out);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
While we used **FileInputStream** in the first example, the I/O stream could have been
any valid I/O stream including website connections, in-memory stream resources, and so
forth. The second example prints the contents of a file directly to the **System.out** stream.

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; c. Copying Files into a Directory
For the exam, it is important that you understand how the `copy()` method operates on
both files and directories. For example, let’s say we have a file, **food.txt**, and a directory,
**/enclosure**. Both the file and directory exist. What do you think is the result of executing
the following process?

```java
var file = Paths.get("food.txt");
var directory = Paths.get("/enclosure");
Files.copy(file, directory);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
If you said it would create a new file at **/enclosure/food.txt**, you’re way off. It
throws an exception. The command tries to create a new file named **/enclosure**. Since the
path **/enclosure** already exists, an exception is thrown at runtime. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
On the other hand, if the directory did not exist, the process would create a new file with
the contents of **food.txt**, but the file would be called **/enclosure**. Remember, we said files
may not need to have extensions, and in this example, it matters. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
This behavior applies to both the `copy()` and `move()` methods, the latter of which we cover
next. In case you’re curious, the correct way to copy the file into the directory is to do the
following:

```java
var file = Paths.get("food.txt");
var directory = Paths.get("/enclosure/food.txt");
Files.copy(file, directory);
```

### &emsp;&emsp; 3. Moving or Renaming Paths with _move()_
The **Files** class provides a useful method for moving or renaming files and directories.

```java
public static Path move(Path source, Path target,
    CopyOption... options) throws IOException
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The following sample code uses the `move()` method:

```java
Files.move(Path.of("C:\\zoo"), Path.of("C:\\zoo-new"));

Files.move(Path.of("C:\\user\\addresses.txt"),
    Path.of("C:\\zoo-new\\addresses2.txt"));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first example renames the zoo directory to a **zoo-new** directory, keeping all of the
original contents from the source directory. The second example moves the **addresses.txt**
file from the directory user to the directory **zoo-new** and renames it **addresses2.txt**.

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a. Similarities between _move()_ and _copy()_
Like `copy()`, `move()` requires **REPLACE_EXISTING** to overwrite the target if it exists; otherwise, 
it will throw an exception. Also like `copy()`, `move()` will not put a file in a directory
if the source is a file and the target is a directory. Instead, it will create a new file with the
name of the directory.

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; b. Performing an Atomic Move
Another enum value that you need to know for the exam when working with the `move()`
method is the **StandardCopyOption** value **ATOMIC_MOVE**.

```java
Files.move(Path.of("mouse.txt"), Path.of("gerbil.txt"),
    StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
You may remember the atomic property from Chapter 13, “Concurrency,” and the principle 
of an atomic move is similar. An atomic move is one in which a file is moved within the
file system as a single indivisible operation. Put another way, any process monitoring the file
system never sees an incomplete or partially written file. If the file system does not support
this feature, an **AtomicMoveNotSupportedException** will be thrown. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Note that while **ATOMIC_MOVE** is available as a member of the **StandardCopyOption**
type, it will likely throw an exception if passed to a `copy()` method.

### &emsp;&emsp; 4. Deleting a File with _delete()_ and _deleteIfExists()_
The **Files** class includes two methods that delete a file or empty directory within the
file system. 

```java
public static void delete(Path path) throws IOException
    
public static boolean deleteIfExists(Path path) throws IOException
```

&emsp;&emsp;
To delete a directory, it must be empty. Both of these methods throw an exception if operated 
on a nonempty directory. In addition, if the path is a symbolic link, the symbolic link
will be deleted, not the path that the symbolic link points to. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The methods differ on how they handle a path that does not exist. The
`delete()` method throws an exception if the path does not exist, while the
`deleteIfExists()` method returns **true** if the delete was successful or **false** otherwise.
Similar to `createDirectories()`, `deleteIfExists()` is useful in situations where you
want to ensure that a path does not exist and delete it if it does. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Here we provide sample code that performs `delete()` operations:

```java
Files.delete(Paths.get("/vulture/feathers.txt"));
Files.deleteIfExists(Paths.get("/pigeon"));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first example deletes the `feathers.txt` file in the **vulture** directory, and it throws
a **NoSuchFileException** if the file or directory does not exist. The second example deletes
the **pigeon** directory, assuming it is empty. If the **pigeon** directory does not exist, the 
second line will not throw an exception.

## VI. Comparing Files with _isSameFile()_ and _mismatch()_
Since a path may include path symbols and symbolic links within a file system, the
`equals()` method can’t be relied on to know if two **Path** instances refer to the same file.
Luckily, there is the `isSameFile()` method. This method takes two **Path** objects as input,
resolves all path symbols, and follows symbolic links. Despite the name, the method can also
be used to determine whether two **Path** objects refer to the same directory. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
While most uses of `isSameFile()` will trigger an exception if the paths do not exist, there is
a special case in which it does not. If the two path objects are equal in terms of `equals()`, the
method will just return **true** without checking whether the file exists. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Assume that the file system exists, as shown in Figure 14.4, with a symbolic link from
**/animals/snake** to **/animals/cobra**.

> **Figure 14.4** Comparing file uniqueness

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter14/figure14.4.png" alt="Figure 14.4" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
Given the structure defined in Figure 14.4, what does the following output?

```java
System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(
    Path.of("/animals/cobra"),
    Path.of("/animals/snake")));


System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(
    Path.of("/animals/monkey/ears.png"),
    Path.of("/animals/wolf/ears.png")));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Since **snake** is a symbolic link to **cobra**, the first example outputs **true**. In the second
example, the paths refer to different files, so **false** is printed. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Sometimes you want to compare the contents of the file rather than whether it is physically 
the same file. For example, we could have two files with text **hello**. The `mismatch()`
method was introduced in Java 12 to help us out here. It takes two **Path** objects as input.
The method returns **-1** if the files are the same; otherwise, it returns the index of the first
position in the file that differs.

```java
System.out.println(Files.mismatch(
    Path.of("/animals/monkey.txt"),
    Path.of("/animals/wolf.txt")));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Suppose **monkey.txt** contains the name **Harold** and **wolf.txt** contains the name
**Howler**. The previous code prints 1 in that case because the second position is different, and
we use zero-based indexing in Java. Given those values, what do you think this code prints?

```java
System.out.println(Files.mismatch(
    Path.of("/animals/wolf.txt"),
    Path.of("/animals/monkey.txt")));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The answer is the same as the previous example. The code prints **1** again. The
`mismatch()` method is symmetric and returns the same result regardless of the order of the
parameters.
