The previous chapter talked a lot about defining variables,
but what can you do with a variable once it is created? This
chapter introduces operators and shows how you can use them
to combine existing variables and create new values. It shows you how to apply operators
to various primitive data types, including introducing you to operators that can be applied
to objects.

# Understanding Java Operators

Before we get into the fun stuff, let’s cover a bit of terminology. A Java _operator_ is a special
symbol that can be applied to a set of variables, values, or literals—referred to as operands—
and that returns a result. The term _operand_, which we use throughout this chapter, refers
to the value or variable the operator is being applied to. Figure 2.1 shows the anatomy of a
Java operation.

&emsp;&emsp;
The output of the operation is simply referred to as the result. Figure 2.1 actually 
contains a second operation, with the assignment operator (=) being used to store the result in
variable c. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We’re sure you have been using the addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators since you
were a little kid. Java supports many other operators that you need to know for the exam.
While many should be review for you, some (such as the compound assignment operators)
may be new to you.

## I. Types of Operators
Java supports three flavors of operators: unary, binary, and ternary. These types of operators
can be applied to one, two, or three operands, respectively. For the exam, you need to know
a specific subset of Java operators, how to apply them, and the order in which they should
be applied. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Java operators are not necessarily evaluated from left-to-right order. In this following
example, the second expression is actually evaluated from right to left, given the specific
operators involved:

```java
int cookies = 4;
double reward = 3 + 2 * --cookies;
System.out.print("Zoo animal receives: " + reward + " reward points");
```

&emsp;&emsp;
In this example, you first decrement **cookies** to `3`, then multiply the resulting value by `2`,
and finally add `3`. The value then is automatically promoted from `9` to `9.0` and assigned to
**reward**. The final values of **reward** and **cookies** are `9.0` and `3`, respectively, with the 
following printed:

```java
Zoo animal receives: 9.0 reward points
```

If you didn’t follow that evaluation, don’t worry. By the end of this chapter, solving 
problems like this should be second nature.

## II. Operator Precedence
When reading a book or a newspaper, some written languages are evaluated from left to
right, while some are evaluated from right to left. In mathematics, certain operators can
override other operators and be evaluated first. Determining which operators are evaluated
in what order is referred to as _operator precedence_. In this manner, Java more closely follows
the rules for mathematics. Consider the following expression:

```java
var perimeter = 2 * height + 2 * length;
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s apply some optional parentheses to demonstrate how the compiler evaluates this
statement:

```java
var perimeter = ((2 * height) + (2 * length));
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The multiplication operator `*` has a higher precedence than the addition operator `+`, so
the **height** and **length** are both multiplied by `2` before being added together. The assignment
operator `=` has the lowest order of precedence, so the assignment to the perimeter variable
is performed last. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Unless overridden with parentheses, Java operators follow _order of operation_, listed in
Table 2.1, by decreasing order of operator precedence. If two operators have the same level
of precedence, then Java guarantees left-to-right evaluation for most operators other than
the ones marked in the table.

&emsp;&emsp;
We recommend keeping Table 2.1 handy throughout this chapter. For the exam, you
need to memorize the order of precedence in this table. Note that you won’t be tested on
some operators, like the shift operators, although we recommend that you be aware of their
existence.

> ### Note:
> The arrow operator (->), sometimes called the arrow function or lambda
operator, is a binary operator that represents a relationship between
two operands. Although we won’t cover the arrow operator in this
chapter, you will see it used in **switch** expressions in Chapter 3, “Making
Decisions,” and in lambda expressions starting in Chapter 8, “Lambdas
and Functional Interfaces.”
