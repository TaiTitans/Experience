# Writing Thread-Safe Code
_Thread-safety_ is the property of an object that guarantees safe execution by multiple threads
at the same time. Since threads run in a shared environment and memory space, how do we
prevent two threads from interfering with each other? We must organize access to data so
that we don’t end up with invalid or unexpected results. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
In this part of the chapter, we show how to use a variety of techniques to protect data,
including atomic classes, synchronized blocks, the Lock framework, and cyclic barriers.

## I. Understanding Thread-Safety
Imagine that our zoo has a program to count sheep, preferably one that won’t put the zoo
workers to sleep! Each zoo worker runs out to a field, adds a new sheep to the flock, counts
the total number of sheep, and runs back to us to report the results. We present the following
code to represent this conceptually, choosing a thread pool size so that all tasks can be run
concurrently:

```java
1:  import java.util.concurrent.*;
2:  public class SheepManager {
3:      private int sheepCount = 0;
4:      private void incrementAndReport() {
5:          System.out.print((++sheepCount)+" ");
6:      }
7:      public static void main(String[] args) {
8:          ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(20);
9:          try {
10:             SheepManager manager = new SheepManager();
11:             for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
12:                 service.submit(() -> manager.incrementAndReport());
13:         } finally {
14:             service.shutdown();
15:         } 
16:     } 
17: }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
What does this program output? You might think it will output numbers from 1 to 10, in
order, but that is far from guaranteed. It may output in a different order. Worse yet, it may
print some numbers twice and not print some numbers at all! The following are possible
outputs of this program:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 9 8 7 3 6 6 2 4 5
1 8 7 3 2 6 5 4 2 9
```

&emsp;&emsp;
So, what went wrong? In this example, we use the pre-increment (++) operator to update
the sheepCount variable. A problem occurs when two threads both execute the right side
of the expression, reading the “old” value before either thread writes the “new” value of the
variable. The two assignments become redundant; they both assign the same new value, with
one thread overwriting the results of the other. Figure 13.4 demonstrates this problem with
two threads, assuming that sheepCount has a starting value of 1.

> **Figure 13.4** Lack of thread synchronization

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter13/figure13.4.png" alt="Figure 13.4" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
You can see in Figure 13.4 that both threads read and write the same values, causing one
of the two **++sheepCount** operations to be lost. Therefore, the increment operator ++ is not
thread-safe. As you will see later in this chapter, the unexpected result of two tasks executing
at the same time is referred to as a _race condition_. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Conceptually, the idea here is that some zoo workers may run faster on their way to the
field but more slowly on their way back and report late. Other workers may get to the field
last but somehow be the first ones back to report the results.

## II. Accessing Data with volatile
The **volatile** keyword is used to guarantee that access to data within memory is 
consistent. For example, it is possible (albeit unlikely) that our **SheepManager** example using
**++sheepCount** returns an unexpected value due to invalid memory access while the code is
executing a critical section. Conceptually, this corresponds to one of our zoo employees 
tripping on the way back from the field and someone asking them the current number of sheep
while they are still trying to get up! <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The **volatile** attribute ensures that only one thread is modifying a variable at one time
and that data read among multiple threads is consistent. In this manner, we don’t interrupt
one of our zoo workers in the middle of running. So, does **volatile** provide thread-safety?
Not exactly. Consider this replacement to our previous application:

```
3:  private volatile int sheepCount = 0;
4:  private void incrementAndReport() {
5:      System.out.print((++sheepCount) + " ");
6:  }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Unfortunately, this code is not thread-safe and could still result in numbers being missed:

```
2 6 1 7 5 3 2 9 4 8
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The reason this code is not thread-safe is that **++sheepCount** is still two distinct
operations. Put another way, if the increment operator represents the expression
`sheepCount = sheepCount + 1`, then each read and write operation is thread-safe,
but the combined operation is not. Referring back to our sheep example, we don’t interrupt 
the employee while running, but we could still have multiple people in the field at the
same time.

> #### Note
> In practice, **volatile** is rarely used. We only cover it because it has been
known to show up on the exam from time to time.

## III. Protecting Data with Atomic Classes
In our previous **SheepManager** applications, the same values were printed twice, with
the highest counter being **9** instead of **10**. As we saw, the increment operator ++ is
not thread-safe, even when **volatile** is used. It is not thread-safe because the operation 
is not atomic, carrying out two tasks, read and write, that can be interrupted by
other threads. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
_Atomic_ is the property of an operation to be carried out as a single unit of execution
without any interference from another thread. A thread-safe atomic version of the increment
operator would perform the read and write of the variable as a single operation, not 
allowing any other threads to access the variable during the operation. Figure 13.5 shows the
result of making the **sheepCount** variable atomic. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
In this case, any thread trying to access the **sheepCount** variable while an atomic operation 
is in process will have to wait until the atomic operation on the variable is complete.
Conceptually, this is like setting a rule for our zoo workers that there can be only one
employee in the field at a time, although they may not each report their results in order.

> **Figure 13.5** Thread synchronization using atomic operations

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter13/figure13.5.png" alt="Figure 13.5" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
Since accessing primitives and references is common in Java, the Concurrency API
includes numerous useful classes in the **java.util.concurrent.atomic** package.
Table 13.6 lists the atomic classes with which you should be familiar for the exam. As with
many of the classes in the Concurrency API, these classes exist to make your life easier.

> **Table 13.6** Atomic Classes
> 
> |Class name |Description|
> |-----------|-----------|
> |AtomicBoolean |A boolean value that may be updated atomically|
> |AtomicInteger |An int value that may be updated atomically|
> |AtomicLong |A long value that may be updated atomically|

&emsp;&emsp;
How do we use an atomic class? Each class includes numerous methods that are
equivalent to many of the primitive built-in operators that we use on primitives, such as the
assignment operator (=) and the increment operators (++). We describe the common atomic
methods that you should know for the exam in Table 13.7. The _type_ is determined by
the class. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
In the following example, assume we import the atomic package and then update our
**SheepManager** class with an **AtomicInteger**:

```
3:  private AtomicInteger sheepCount = new AtomicInteger(0);
4:  private void incrementAndReport() {
5:      System.out.print(sheepCount.incrementAndGet() + " ");
6:  }
```

> **Table 13.7** Common atomic Methods
> 
> |Method |Description|
> |-------|-----------|
> |get() |Retrieves current value|
> |set(type newValue) |Sets given value, equivalent to assignment = operator|
> |getAndSet(type newValue) |Atomically sets new value and returns old value|
> |incrementAndGet() |For numeric classes, atomic pre-increment operation equivalent to ++value|
> |getAndIncrement() |For numeric classes, atomic post-increment operation equivalent to value++|
> |decrementAndGet() |For numeric classes, atomic pre-decrement operation equivalent to --value|
> |getAndDecrement() |For numeric classes, atomic post-decrement operation equivalent to value--|

&emsp;&emsp;
How does this implementation differ from our previous examples? When we run this
modification, we get varying output, such as the following:

```
2 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 4 3 2 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 4 3 5 6 2 7 8 10 9
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Unlike our previous sample output, the numbers 1 through 10 will always be printed,
although the order is still not guaranteed. Don’t worry; we address that issue shortly. The
key in this section is that using the atomic classes ensures that the data is consistent between
workers and that no values are lost due to concurrent modifications.

## IV. Improving Access with _synchronized_ Blocks
While atomic classes are great at protecting a single variable, they aren’t particularly useful if
you need to execute a series of commands or call a method. For example, we can’t use them
to update two atomic variables at the same time. How do we improve the results so that
each worker is able to increment and report the results in order? <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The most common technique is to use a monitor to synchronize access. A _monitor_, also
called a _lock_, is a structure that supports _mutual exclusion_, which is the property that at
most one thread is executing a particular segment of code at a given time.

&emsp;&emsp;
In Java, any **Object** can be used as a monitor, along with the **synchronized** keyword,
as shown in the following example:

```java
var manager = new SheepManager();
synchronized(manager) {
    // Work to be completed by one thread at a time
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This example is referred to as a _synchronized block_. Each thread that arrives will first
check if any threads are already running the block. If the lock is not available, the thread
will transition to a **BLOCKED** state until it can “acquire the lock.” If the lock is available (or
the thread already holds the lock), the single thread will enter the block, preventing all other
threads from entering. Once the thread finishes executing the block, it will release the lock,
allowing one of the waiting threads to proceed.

> #### Note
> To synchronize access across multiple threads, each thread must have
access to the _same_ **Object**. If each thread synchronizes on different
objects, the code is not thread-safe.

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s revisit our **SheepManager** example that used _++sheepCount_ and see whether we
can improve the results so that each worker increments and outputs the counter in order.
Let’s say that we replaced our `for()` loop with the following implementation:

```
11: for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
12:     synchronized(manager) {
13:         service.submit(() -> manager.incrementAndReport());
14:     }
15: }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Does this solution fix the problem? No, it does not! Can you spot the problem? We’ve
synchronized the _creation_ of the threads but not the _execution_ of the threads. In this
example, the threads would be created one at a time, but they might all still execute and 
perform their work simultaneously, resulting in the same type of output that you saw earlier. We
did say diagnosing and resolving thread problems is difficult in practice! <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We now present a corrected version of the **SheepManager** class that orders the workers:

```
1:  import java.util.concurrent.*;
2:  public class SheepManager {
3:      private int sheepCount = 0;
4:      private void incrementAndReport() {
5:          synchronized(this) {
6:              System.out.print((++sheepCount) + " ");
7:          }
8:      }
9:      public static void main(String[] args) {
10:         ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(20);
11:         try {
12:             var manager = new SheepManager();
13:             for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
14:                 service.submit(() -> manager.incrementAndReport());
15:         } finally {
16:             service.shutdown();
17:         }
18:     }
19: }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
When this code executes, it will consistently output the following:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Although all threads are still created and executed at the same time, they each wait at
the **synchronized** block for the worker to increment and report the result before entering.
In this manner, each zoo worker waits for the previous zoo worker to come back before
running out on the field. While it’s random which zoo worker will run out next, it is guaranteed 
that there will be at most one on the field and that the results will be reported in order. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We could have synchronized on any object, as long as it was the same object. For
example, the following code snippet would also work:

```
4:  private final Object herd = new Object();
5:  private void incrementAndReport() {
6:      synchronized(herd) {
7:          System.out.print((++sheepCount)+" ");
8:      }
9:  }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Although we didn’t need to make the **herd** variable **final**, doing so ensures that it is not
reassigned after threads start using it.

## V. Synchronizing on Methods
In the previous example, we established our monitor using `synchronized(this)` around the
body of the method. Java provides a more convenient compiler enhancement for doing so.
We can add the **synchronized** modifier to any instance method to synchronize automatically
on the object itself. For example, the following two method definitions are equivalent:

```java
void sing() {
    synchronized(this) {
        System.out.print("La la la!");
    }
}
synchronized void sing() {
    System.out.print("La la la!");
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first uses a **synchronized** block, whereas the second uses the **synchronized**
method modifier. Which you use is completely up to you. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We can also apply the **synchronized** modifier to **static** methods. What object is used
as the monitor when we synchronize on a **static** method? The class object, of course! For
example, the following two methods are equivalent for **static** synchronization inside our
**SheepManager** class:

```java
static void dance() {
    synchronized(SheepManager.class) {
        System.out.print("Time to dance!");
    }
}
static synchronized void dance() {
    System.out.print("Time to dance!");
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
As before, the first uses a **synchronized** block, with the second example using the
**synchronized** modifier. You can use **static** synchronization if you need to order thread
access across all instances rather than a single instance.

## VI. Understanding the Lock Framework
A **synchronized** block supports only a limited set of functionality. For example, what if we
want to check whether a lock is available and, if it is not, perform some other task? Furthermore, 
if the lock is never available and we synchronize on it, we might wait forever. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The Concurrency API includes the **Lock** interface, which is conceptually similar to using
the **synchronized** keyword but with a lot more bells and whistles. Instead of synchronizing on
any **Object**, though, we can “lock” only on an object that implements the **Lock** interface.

### &emsp;&emsp; 1. Applying a _ReentrantLock_
The Lock interface is pretty easy to use. When you need to protect a piece of code from 
multithreaded processing, create an instance of **Lock** that all threads have access to. Each thread
then calls `lock()` before it enters the protected code and calls `unlock()` before it exits the
protected code. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
For contrast, the following shows two implementations, one with a **synchronized** block
and one with a **Lock** instance. While longer, the **Lock** solution has a number of features not
available to the **synchronized** block.

```java
// Implementation #1 with a synchronized block
Object object = new Object();
synchronized(object) {
    // Protected code
}
// Implementation #2 with a Lock
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
try {
    lock.lock();
    // Protected code
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
These two implementations are conceptually equivalent. The **ReentrantLock** class is a
simple monitor that implements the **Lock** interface and supports mutual exclusion. In other
words, at most one thread is allowed to hold a lock at any given time.

> #### Tip
> While certainly not required, it is a good practice to use a **try**/**finally**
block with **Lock** instances. Doing so ensures that any acquired locks are
properly released.

&emsp;&emsp;
The **ReentrantLock** class ensures that once a thread has called `lock()` and
obtained the lock, all other threads that call `lock()` will wait until the first thread calls
`unlock()`. Which thread gets the lock next depends on the parameters used to create the
**Lock** object. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The **ReentrantLock** class includes a constructor that takes a single boolean and sets
a “fairness” parameter. If the parameter is set to **true**, the lock will usually be granted to
each thread in the order in which it was requested. It is **false** by default when using the
no-argument constructor. In practice, you should enable fairness only when ordering is absolutely 
required, as it could lead to a significant slowdown. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Besides always making sure to release a lock, you also need to be sure that you only
release a lock that you have. If you attempt to release a lock that you do not have, you will
get an exception at runtime.

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.unlock(); // IllegalMonitorStateException
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The Lock interface includes four methods you should know for the exam, as listed in
Table 13.8.

> **Table 13.8** Lock Methods
>
> |Method |Description|
> |-------|-----------|
> |void **lock**() |Requests lock and blocks until lock is acquired.
> |void **unlock**() |Releases lock.
> |boolean **tryLock**() |Requests lock and returns immediately. Returns boolean indicating whether lock was successfully acquired.
> |boolean **tryLock**(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) |Requests lock and blocks for specified time or until lock is acquired. Returns boolean indicating whether lock was successfully acquired.

### &emsp;&emsp; 2. Attempting to Acquire a Lock
While the **ReentrantLock** class allows you to wait for a lock, it so far suffers from the
same problem as a **synchronized** block. A thread could end up waiting forever to obtain a
lock. Luckily, Table 13.8 includes two additional methods that make the **Lock** interface a lot
safer to use than a **synchronized** block. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
For convenience, we use the following `printHello()` method for the code in this section:

```java
public static void printHello(Lock lock) {
    try {
        lock.lock();
        System.out.println("Hello");
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
}
```

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a. _tryLock()_
The `tryLock()` method will attempt to acquire a lock and immediately return a boolean
result indicating whether the lock was obtained. Unlike the `lock()` method, it does not wait
if another thread already holds the lock. It returns immediately, regardless of whether a lock
is available. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The following is a sample implementation using the `tryLock()` method:

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
new Thread(() -> printHello(lock)).start();
if (lock.tryLock()) {
    try {
        System.out.println("Lock obtained, entering protected code");
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("Unable to acquire lock, doing something else");
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
When you run this code, it could produce either the **if** or **else** message, depending
on the order of execution. It will always print **Hello**, though, as the call to `lock()` in
`printHello()` will wait indefinitely for the lock to become available. A fun exercise is to
insert some `Thread.sleep()` delays into this snippet to encourage a particular message
to be displayed. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Like `lock()`, the `tryLock()` method should be used with a **try**/**finally** block. Fortunately, 
you need to release the lock only if it was successfully acquired. For this reason, it
is common to use the output of `tryLock()` in an **if** statement, so that `unlock()` is called
only when the lock is obtained.

> #### Tip
> It is imperative that your program always check the return value of the
`tryLock()` method. It tells your program whether it is safe to proceed
with the operation and whether the lock needs to be released later.

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; b. _tryLock(long, TimeUnit)_
The **Lock** interface includes an overloaded version of `tryLock(long, TimeUnit)` that acts
like a hybrid of `lock()` and `tryLock()`. Like the other two methods, if a lock is available,
it will immediately return with it. If a lock is unavailable, though, it will wait up to 
the specified time limit for the lock. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The following code snippet uses the overloaded version of `tryLock(long,TimeUnit)`:

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
new Thread(() -> printHello(lock)).start();
if (lock.tryLock(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
    try {
        System.out.println("Lock obtained, entering protected code");
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("Unable to acquire lock, doing something else");
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The code is the same as before, except this time, one of the threads waits up to 10 seconds
to acquire the lock.

### &emsp;&emsp; 3. Acquiring the Same Lock Twice
The **ReentrantLock** class maintains a counter of the number of times a lock has been successfully 
granted to a thread. To release the lock for other threads to use, `unlock()` must be called
the same number of times the lock was granted. The following code snippet contains an
error. Can you spot it? 

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
if (lock.tryLock()) {
    try {
        lock.lock();
        System.out.println("Lock obtained, entering protected code");
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    } 
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The thread obtains the lock twice but releases it only once. You can verify this by
spawning a new thread after this code runs that attempts to obtain a lock. The following
prints **false**:

```java
new Thread(() -> System.out.print(lock.tryLock())).start(); // false
```

&emsp;&emsp;
_It is critical that you release a lock the same number of times it is acquired!_ For calls with
`tryLock()`, you need to call `unlock()` only if the method returned **true**.

### &emsp;&emsp; 4. Reviewing the _Lock_ Framework
To review, the ReentrantLock class supports the same features as a synchronized block while
adding a number of improvements:
- Ability to request a lock without blocking.
- Ability to request a lock while blocking for a specified amount of time.
- A lock can be created with a fairness property, in which the lock is granted to threads in
  the order in which it was requested.

> #### Tip
> While not on the exam, **ReentrantReadWriteLock** is a really useful
class. It includes separate locks for reading and writing data and is useful
on data structures where reads are far more common than writes. For
example, if you have a thousand threads reading data but only one thread
writing data, this class can help you maximize concurrent access.

## VII. Orchestrating Tasks with a _CyclicBarrier_
We started the thread-safety topic by discussing protecting individual variables and then
moved on to blocks of code and locks. We complete our discussion of thread-safety by showing 
how to orchestrate complex tasks with many steps. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Our zoo workers are back, and this time they are cleaning pens. Imagine a lion pen that
needs to be emptied, cleaned, and then refilled with the lions. To complete the task, we have
assigned four zoo workers. Obviously, we don’t want to start cleaning the cage while a lion
is roaming in it, lest we end up losing a zoo worker! Furthermore, we don’t want to let the
lions back into the pen while it is still being cleaned. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We could have all of the work completed by a single worker, but this would be slow and
ignore the fact that we have three zoo workers standing by to help. A better solution would
be to have all four zoo employees work concurrently, pausing between the end of one set of
tasks and the start of the next. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
To coordinate these tasks, we can use the **CyclicBarrier** class.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
public class LionPenManager {
    private void removeLions() { System.out.println("Removing lions"); }
    private void cleanPen() { System.out.println("Cleaning the pen"); }
    private void addLions() { System.out.println("Adding lions"); }
    public void performTask() {
        removeLions();
        cleanPen();
        addLions();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
        try {
            var manager = new LionPenManager();
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
                service.submit(() -> manager.performTask());
        } finally {
            service.shutdown();
        } 
    } 
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The following is sample output based on this implementation:

```
Removing lions
Removing lions
Cleaning the pen
Adding lions
Removing lions
Cleaning the pen
Adding lions
Removing lions
Cleaning the pen
Adding lions
Cleaning the pen
Adding lions
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Although the results are ordered within a single thread, the output is entirely random
among multiple workers. We see that some lions are still being removed while the cage is
being cleaned, and other lions are added before the cleaning process is finished. Let’s hope
none of the zoo workers get eaten! <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We can improve these results by using the **CyclicBarrier** class. The **CyclicBarrier** takes in
its constructors a **limit** value, indicating the number of threads to wait for. As each thread
finishes, it calls the `await()` method on the cyclic barrier. Once the specified number of threads
have each called `await()`, the barrier is released, and all threads can continue.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
public class LionPenManager {
    private void removeLions() { System.out.println("Removing lions"); }
    private void cleanPen() { System.out.println("Cleaning the pen"); }
    private void addLions() { System.out.println("Adding lions"); }
    public void performTask(CyclicBarrier c1, CyclicBarrier c2) {
        try {
            removeLions();
            c1.await();
            cleanPen();
            c2.await();
            addLions();
        } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
            // Handle checked exceptions here
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
        try {
            var manager = new LionPenManager();
            var c1 = new CyclicBarrier(4);
            var c2 = new CyclicBarrier(4,
                () -> System.out.println("*** Pen Cleaned!"));
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
                service.submit(() -> manager.performTask(c1, c2));
        } finally {
            service.shutdown();
        } 
    } 
}
```

The following is sample output based on this revised implementation of our **LionPenManager** class:

```
Removing lions
Removing lions
Removing lions
Removing lions
Cleaning the pen
Cleaning the pen
Cleaning the pen
Cleaning the pen
*** Pen Cleaned!
Adding lions
Adding lions
Adding lions
Adding lions
```

&emsp;&emsp;
As you can see, all of the results are now organized. Removing the lions happens in one
step, as does cleaning the pen and adding the lions back in. In this example, we used two
different constructors for our **CyclicBarrier** objects, the latter of which executes a
Runnable instance upon completion. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The **CyclicBarrier** class allows us to perform complex, multithreaded tasks while all
threads stop and wait at logical barriers. This solution is superior to a single-threaded 
solution, as the individual tasks, such as removing the lions, can be completed in parallel by all
four zoo workers.

> #### Reusing _CyclicBarrier_
> After a **CyclicBarrier** limit is reached (aka the barrier is broken), all threads are released,
and the number of threads waiting on the **CyclicBarrier** goes back to zero. At this point,
the **CyclicBarrier** may be used again for a new set of waiting threads. For example, if our
**CyclicBarrier** limit is 5 and we have 15 threads that call `await()`, the **CyclicBarrier**
will be activated a total of three times.
