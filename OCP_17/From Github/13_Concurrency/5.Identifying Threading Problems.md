# Identifying Threading Problems
Now that you know how to write thread-safe code, let’s talk about what qualifies as a
threading problem. A threading problem can occur in multithreaded applications when two
or more threads interact in an unexpected and undesirable way. For example, two threads
may block each other from accessing a particular segment of code. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The Concurrency API was created to help eliminate potential threading issues common to
all developers. As you have seen, the Concurrency API creates threads and manages complex
thread interactions for you, often in just a few lines of code. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Although the Concurrency API reduces the potential for threading issues, it does not eliminate 
them. In practice, finding and identifying threading issues within an application is often
one of the most difficult tasks a developer can undertake.

## I. Understanding Liveness
As you have seen in this chapter, many thread operations can be performed independently,
but some require coordination. For example, synchronizing on a method requires all threads
that call the method to wait for other threads to finish before continuing. You also saw
earlier in the chapter that threads in a **CyclicBarrier** will each wait for the barrier limit to be
reached before continuing. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
What happens to the application while all of these threads are waiting? In many cases, the
waiting is ephemeral, and the user has very little idea that any delay has occurred. In other
cases, though, the waiting may be extremely long, perhaps infinite. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
_Liveness_ is the ability of an application to be able to execute in a timely manner. Liveness
problems, then, are those in which the application becomes unresponsive or is in some kind
of “stuck” state. More precisely, liveness problems are often the result of a thread entering
a **BLOCKING** or **WAITING** state forever, or repeatedly entering/exiting these states. For the
exam, there are three types of liveness issues with which you should be familiar: deadlock,
starvation, and livelock.

### &emsp;&emsp; 1. Deadlock
_Deadlock_ occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting on the other.
We can illustrate this principle with the following example. Imagine that our zoo has two
foxes: Foxy and Tails. Foxy likes to eat first and then drink water, while Tails likes to drink
water first and then eat. Furthermore, neither animal likes to share, and they will finish their
meal only if they have exclusive access to both food and water. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The zookeeper places the food on one side of the environment and the water on the other
side. Although our foxes are fast, it still takes them 100 milliseconds to run from one side of
the environment to the other. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
What happens if Foxy gets the food first and Tails gets the water first? The following
application models this behavior:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
class Food {}
class Water {}
public record Fox(String name) {
    public void eatAndDrink(Food food, Water water) {
        synchronized(food) {
            System.out.println(name() + " Got Food!");
            move();
            synchronized(water) {
                System.out.println(name() + " Got Water!");
            } 
        } 
    }
    public void drinkAndEat(Food food, Water water) {
        synchronized(water) {
            System.out.println(name() + " Got Water!");
            move();
            synchronized(food) {
                System.out.println(name() + " Got Food!");
            } 
        } 
    }
    public void move() {
        try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create participants and resources
        var foxy = new Fox("Foxy");
        var tails = new Fox("Tails");
        var food = new Food();
        var water = new Water();
        // Process data
        var service = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(10);
        try {
            service.submit(() -> foxy.eatAndDrink(food,water));
            service.submit(() -> tails.drinkAndEat(food,water));
        } finally {
            service.shutdown();
        } 
    } 
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
In this example, Foxy obtains the food and then moves to the other side of the environment to obtain the water. Unfortunately, Tails already drank the water and is waiting for the
food to become available. The result is that our program outputs the following, and it hangs
indefinitely:

```
Foxy Got Food!
Tails Got Water!
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This example is considered a deadlock because both participants are permanently
blocked, waiting on resources that will never become available.

### &emsp;&emsp; 2. Starvation
_Starvation_ occurs when a single thread is perpetually denied access to a shared resource
or lock. The thread is still active, but it is unable to complete its work as a result of other
threads constantly taking the resource that it is trying to access. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
In our fox example, imagine that we have a pack of very hungry, very competitive foxes
in our environment. Every time Foxy stands up to go get food, one of the other foxes sees
her and rushes to eat before her. Foxy is free to roam around the enclosure, take a nap, and
howl for a zookeeper but is never able to obtain access to the food. In this example, Foxy
literally and figuratively experiences starvation. It’s a good thing that this is just a 
theoretical example!

### &emsp;&emsp; 3. Livelock
_Livelock_ occurs when two or more threads are conceptually blocked forever, although they
are each still active and trying to complete their task. Livelock is a special case of resource
starvation in which two or more threads actively try to acquire a set of locks, are unable to
do so, and restart part of the process. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Livelock is often a result of two threads trying to resolve a deadlock. Returning to our
fox example, imagine that Foxy and Tails are both holding their food and water resources,
respectively. They each realize that they cannot finish their meal in this state, so they both
let go of their food and water, run to the opposite side of the environment, and pick up the
other resource. Now Foxy has the water, Tails has the food, and neither is able to finish
their meal! <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
If Foxy and Tails continue this process forever, it is referred to as _livelock_. Both Foxy and
Tails are active, running back and forth across their area, but neither can finish their meal.
Foxy and Tails are executing a form of failed deadlock recovery. Each fox notices that they
are potentially entering a deadlock state and responds by releasing all of its locked resources.
Unfortunately, the lock and unlock process is cyclical, and the two foxes are conceptually
deadlocked. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
In practice, livelock is often a difficult issue to detect. Threads in a livelock state appear
active and able to respond to requests, even when they are stuck in an endless cycle.

## II. Managing Race Conditions
A _race condition_ is an undesirable result that occurs when two tasks that should be 
completed sequentially are completed at the same time. We encountered examples of race 
conditions earlier in the chapter when we introduced synchronization. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
While Figure 13.4 shows a classical thread-based example of a race condition, we now provide
a more illustrative example. Imagine that two zoo patrons, Olivia and Sophia, are signing up
for an account on the zoo’s new visitor website. Both of them want to use the same username,
**ZooFan**, and each sends a request to create the account at the same time, as shown in Figure 13.6.

> **Figure 13.6** Race condition on user creation

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter13/figure13.6.png" alt="Figure 13.6" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
What result does the web server return when both users attempt to create an account
with the same username in Figure 13.6? <br />

**Possible Outcomes for This Race Condition**
- Both users are able to create accounts with the username **ZooFan**.
- Neither user is able to create an account with the username **ZooFan**, and an error 
  message is returned to both users.
- One user is able to create an account with the username **ZooFan**, while the other user
  receives an error message.

&emsp;&emsp;
The first outcome is _really bad_, as it leads to users trying to log in with the same username. 
Whose data do they see when they log in? The second outcome causes both users to
have to try again, which is frustrating but at least doesn’t lead to corrupt or bad data. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
The third outcome is often considered the best solution. Like the second situation, we preserve 
data integrity; but unlike the second situation, at least one user is able to move forward
on the first request, avoiding additional race condition scenarios. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
For the exam, you should understand that race conditions lead to invalid data if they are
not properly handled. Even the solution where both participants fail to proceed is preferable
to one in which invalid data is permitted to enter the system.
