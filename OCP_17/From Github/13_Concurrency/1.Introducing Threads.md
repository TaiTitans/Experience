# Introducing Threads
We begin this chapter by reviewing common terminology associated with threads. A _thread_
is the smallest unit of execution that can be scheduled by the operating system. A _process_
is a group of associated threads that execute in the same shared environment. It follows,
then, that a _single-threaded process_ is one that contains exactly one thread, whereas a 
_multi-threaded process_ supports more than one thread. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
By _shared environment_, we mean that the threads in the same process share the same
memory space and can communicate directly with one another. Refer to Figure 13.1 for an
overview of threads and their shared environment within a process. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
This figure shows a single process with three threads. It also shows how they are mapped
to an arbitrary number of _n_ CPUs available within the system. Keep this diagram in mind
when we discuss task schedulers later in this section. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
In this chapter, we talk a lot about tasks and their relationships to threads. A _task_ is a
single unit of work performed by a thread. Throughout this chapter, a task will commonly
be implemented as a lambda expression. A thread can complete multiple independent tasks
but only one task at a time.

&emsp;&emsp;
By _shared memory_ in Figure 13.1, we are generally referring to **static** variables as well
as instance and local variables passed to a thread. Yes, you finally see how **static** variables
can be useful for performing complex, multithreaded tasks! Remember from Chapter 5,
“Methods,” that **static** methods and variables are defined on a single class object that
all instances share. For example, if one thread updates the value of a **static** object, this
information is immediately available for other threads within the process to read.

## I. Understanding Thread Concurrency
The property of executing multiple threads and processes at the same time is referred to
as _concurrency_. How does the system decide what to execute when there are more threads
available than CPUs? Operating systems use a _thread scheduler_ to determine which threads
should be currently executing, as shown in Figure 13.1. For example, a thread scheduler may
employ a _round-robin schedule_ in which each available thread receives an equal number of
CPU cycles with which to execute, with threads visited in a circular order. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
When a thread’s allotted time is complete but the thread has not finished processing, a
context switch occurs. A _context switch_ is the process of storing a thread’s current state and
later restoring the state of the thread to continue execution. Be aware that a cost is often
associated with a context switch due to lost time and having to reload a thread’s state. 
Intelligent thread schedulers do their best to minimize the number of context switches while
keeping an application running smoothly. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Finally, a thread can interrupt or supersede another thread if it has a higher thread 
priority than the other thread. A _thread priority_ is a numeric value associated with a thread that
is taken into consideration by the thread scheduler when determining which threads should
currently be executing. In Java, thread priorities are specified as integer values.

## II. Creating a Thread
One of the most common ways to define a task for a thread is by using the **Runnable** 
instance. **Runnable** is a functional interface that takes no arguments and returns no data.

```java
@FunctionalInterface public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
With this, it’s easy to create and start a thread. In fact, you can do so in one line of code
using the **Thread** class:

```java
new Thread(() -> System.out.print("Hello")).start();
System.out.print("World");
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first line creates a new **Thread** object and then starts it with the `start()` method.
Does this code print **HelloWorld** or **WorldHello**? The answer is that we don’t know.
Depending on the thread priority/scheduler, either is possible. Remember that order of
thread execution is not often guaranteed. The exam commonly presents questions in which
multiple tasks are started at the same time, and you must determine the result. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s take a look at a more complex example:

```java
Runnable printInventory = () -> System.out.println("Printing zoo inventory");
Runnable printRecords = () -> {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    System.out.println("Printing record: " + i);
};
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Given these instances, what is the output of the following?

```java
3:  System.out.println("begin");
4:  new Thread(printInventory).start();
5:  new Thread(printRecords).start();
6:  new Thread(printInventory).start();
7:  System.out.println("end");
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The answer is that it is unknown until runtime. The following is just one possible output:

```
begin
Printing record: 0
Printing zoo inventory
end
Printing record: 1
Printing zoo inventory
Printing record: 2
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This sample uses a total of four threads: the `main()` user thread and three 
additional threads created on lines 4–6. Each thread created on these lines is executed as an
asynchronous task. By _asynchronous_, we mean that the thread executing the `main()` method
does not wait for the results of each newly created thread before continuing. For example,
lines 5 and 6 may be executed before the thread created on line 4 finishes. The opposite of
this behavior is a _synchronous_ task in which the program waits (or _blocks_) on line 4 for the
thread to finish executing before moving on to the next line. The vast majority of method
calls used in this book have been synchronous up until this chapter. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
While the order of thread execution is indeterminate once the threads have been started,
the order within a single thread is still linear. In particular, the `for()` loop is still ordered. Also,
begin always appears before end.

> #### Calling _run()_ Instead of _start()_
> On the exam, be mindful of code that attempts to start a thread by calling `run()` instead of
`start()`. Calling `run()` on a **Thread** or a **Runnable** _does not start a new thread_. While
the following code snippets will compile, none will execute a task on a separate thread:
> ```java
> System.out.println("begin");
> new Thread(printInventory).run();
> new Thread(printRecords).run();
> new Thread(printInventory).run();
> System.out.println("end");
> ```
> Unlike the previous example, each line of this code will wait until the `run()` method is
complete before moving on to the next line. Also unlike the previous program, the output
for this code sample will be the same every time it is executed.

&emsp;&emsp;
More generally, we can create a **Thread** and its associated task one of two ways in Java:
- Provide a **Runnable** object or lambda expression to the **Thread** constructor.
- Create a class that extends **Thread** and overrides the `run()` method.

&emsp;&emsp;
Throughout this book, we prefer creating tasks with lambda expressions. After all, it’s
a lot easier, especially when we get to the Concurrency API! Creating a class that extends
Thread is relatively uncommon and should only be done under certain circumstances, such as
if you need to overwrite other thread methods.

## III. Distinguishing Thread Types
It might surprise you that all Java applications, including all of the ones that we have 
presented in this book, are multi-threaded because they include system threads. A _system thread_
is created by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and runs in the background of the application.
For example, garbage collection is managed by a system thread created by the JVM. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Alternatively, a _user-defined_ thread is one created by the application developer to 
accomplish a specific task. The majority of the programs we’ve presented so far have contained
only one user-defined thread, which calls the `main()` method. For simplicity, we commonly 
refer to programs that contain only a single user-defined thread as _single-threaded
applications_. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
System and user-defined threads can both be created as daemon threads. A _daemon thread_
is one that will not prevent the JVM from exiting when the program finishes. A Java 
application terminates when the only threads that are running are daemon threads. For example, if
garbage collection is the only thread left running, the JVM will automatically shut down. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s take a look at an example. What do you think this outputs?

```java
1:  public class Zoo {
2:      public static void pause() {                // Defines the thread task
3:          try {
4:              Thread.sleep(10_000);               // Wait for 10 seconds
5:          } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
6:              System.out.println("Thread finished!");
7:          }
8: 
9:      public static void main(String[] unused) {
10:         var job = new Thread(() -> pause());    // Create thread
11:
12:         job.start();                            // Start thread
13:         System.out.println("Main method finished!");
14:     } }
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The program will output two statements roughly 10 seconds apart:

```
Main method finished!
--- 10 second wait ---
Thread finished!
```

&emsp;&emsp;
That’s right. Even though the `main()` method is done, the JVM will wait for the user
thread to be done before ending the program. What if we change **job** to be a daemon thread
by adding this to line 11?

```java
11:         job.setDaemon(true);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The program will print the first statement and terminate without ever printing the
second line.

```
Main method finished!
```

&emsp;&emsp;
For the exam, just remember that by default, user-defined threads are not daemons, and
the program will wait for them to finish.

## IV. Managing a Thread’s Life Cycle
After a thread has been created, it is in one of six states, shown in Figure 13.2. You can
query a thread’s state by calling `getState()` on the thread object.

> **Figure 13.2** Thread states

<img src="https://github.com/khoahd7621/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-practice/blob/main/images/chapter13/figure13.2.png" alt="Figure 13.2" width="700" />

&emsp;&emsp;
Every thread is initialized with a **NEW** state. As soon as `start()` is called, the thread is
moved to a **RUNNABLE** state. Does that mean it is actually running? Not exactly: it may be
running, or it may not be. The **RUNNABLE** state just means the thread is able to be run. Once
the work for the thread is completed or an uncaught exception is thrown, the thread state
becomes **TERMINATED**, and no more work is performed. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
While in a **RUNNABLE** state, the thread may transition to one of three states where it
pauses its work: **BLOCKED**, **WAITING**, or **TIMED_WAITING**. This figure includes common
transitions between thread states, but there are other possibilities. For example, a thread in a
**WAITING** state might be triggered by `notifyAll()`. Likewise, a thread that is interrupted by
another thread will exit **TIMED_WAITING** and go straight back into **RUNNABLE**. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We cover some (but not all) of these transitions in this chapter. Some thread-related
methods—such as `wait()`, `notify()`, and `join()`—are beyond the scope of the exam and,
frankly, difficult to use well. You should avoid them and use the Concurrency API as much
as possible. It takes a large amount of skill (and some luck!) to use these methods correctly.

## V. Polling with Sleep
Even though multi-threaded programming allows you to execute multiple tasks at the same
time, one thread often needs to wait for the results of another thread to proceed. One
solution is to use polling. _Polling_ is the process of intermittently checking data at some
fixed interval. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s say you have a thread that modifies a shared **static counter** value, and your
`main()` thread is waiting for the thread to reach 1 million:

```java
public class CheckResults {
    private static int counter = 0;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Thread(() -> {
            for(int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) counter++;
        }).start();
        while(counter < 1_000_000) {
            System.out.println("Not reached yet");
        }
        System.out.println("Reached: "+counter);
    }
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
How many times does this program print **Not reached yet**? The answer is, we don’t
know! It could output 0, 10, or a million times. Using a `while()` loop to check for data
without some kind of delay is considered a bad coding practice as it ties up CPU resources
for no reason. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
We can improve this result by using the `Thread.sleep()` method to implement polling
and sleep for 1,000 milliseconds, aka 1 second:

```java
public class CheckResultsWithSleep {
    private static int counter = 0;
    public static void main(String[] a) {
        new Thread(() -> {
        for(int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) counter++;
        }).start();
        while(counter < 1_000_000) {
            System.out.println("Not reached yet");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1_000); // 1 SECOND
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Interrupted!");
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Reached: "+counter);
    } 
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
While one second may seem like a small amount, we have now freed the CPU to do
other work instead of checking the counter variable infinitely within a loop. Notice that
the `main()` thread alternates between **TIMED_WAITING** and **RUNNABLE** when `sleep()` is
entered and exited, respectively. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
How many times does the `while()` loop execute in this revised class? Still unknown! While
polling does prevent the CPU from being overwhelmed with a potentially infinite loop, it
does not guarantee when the loop will terminate. For example, the separate thread could be
losing CPU time to a higher-priority process, resulting in multiple executions of the `while()`
loop before it finishes. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
Another issue to be concerned about is the shared **counter** variable. What if one thread is
reading the **counter** variable while another thread is writing it? The thread reading the shared
variable may end up with an invalid or unexpected value. We discuss these issues in detail in
the upcoming section on writing thread-safe code.

## VI. Interrupting a Thread
While our previous solution prevented the CPU from waiting endlessly on a `while()` loop, it
did come at the cost of inserting one-second delays into our program. If the task takes 2.1
seconds to run, the program will use the full 3 seconds, wasting 0.9 seconds. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;
One way to improve this program is to allow the thread to interrupt the `main()` thread
when it’s done:

```java
public class CheckResultsWithSleepAndInterrupt {
    private static int counter = 0;
    public static void main(String[] a) {
        final var mainThread = Thread.currentThread();
        new Thread(() -> {
            for(int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) counter++;
            mainThread.interrupt();
        }).start();
        while(counter < 1_000_000) {
            System.out.println("Not reached yet");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1_000); // 1 SECOND
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Interrupted!");
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Reached: "+counter);
    } 
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This improved version includes both `sleep()`, to avoid tying up the CPU, and
`interrupt()`, so the thread’s work ends without delaying the program. As before, our
`main()` thread’s state alternates between **TIMED_WAITING** and **RUNNABLE**. Calling
`interrupt()` on a thread in the **TIMED_WAITING** or **WAITING** state causes the `main()`
thread to become **RUNNABLE** again, triggering an **InterruptedException**. The thread
may also move to a **BLOCKED** state if it needs to reacquire resources when it wakes up.

> #### Note
> Calling `interrupt()` on a thread already in a **RUNNABLE** state doesn’t
change the state. In fact, it only changes the behavior if the thread is 
periodically checking the `Thread.isInterrupted()` value state.
